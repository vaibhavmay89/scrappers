<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am Apurva Singhal, a Second year B.Tech student in the Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, enrolled in the course of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee (IIT Roorkee), considered to be one of the best technical institutes in the world.</p>
<p>I have always believed that academic knowledge flourishes only when it's applied.</p>
<p>I have gone through your article <strong>{{Article}}</strong> published in {{Journal}} and I am very keen to do some work in this field under your able guidance. It spoke high of your knowledge and experience, and insisted that the opportunities available in your department will further enhance my knowledge in my fields of study.</p>
<p>Therefore, I am keen in pursuing summer internship (May to Mid-July-2014) at your university under your able guidance. The research project that I am willing do under you might form the basis of my degree project of one year duration and hence I will gain doubly from the experience.</p>
<p>Studying at a competitive institute like IIT Roorkee, I have developed a strong technical base and also a passion for research in my fields of study. Further the project oriented labs have given me the opportunity to develop my skills to work in a team and instilled in me excellent analytical troubleshooting and problem-solving skills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Hence sir, I request you to consider me for an internship under your expert guidance for a suitable available project in the above fields. My university vacations will be from around first week of May till 15th of July, 2011 and I would be more than willing to pursue a project under you during this period of time. I hope that you would take a decision in favor of a hard working person who has faith in his abilities.</p>
<p>My curriculum vitae and references are enclosed.</p>
<p>Thank you for your kind consideration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With warm regards<br /><br /> Yours Sincerely, <br /><br /> <strong>Apurva Singhal</strong> <br /> IIT Roorkee<br /> Roorkee, UP<br /> India</p>
