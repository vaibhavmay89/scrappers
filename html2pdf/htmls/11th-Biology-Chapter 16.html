<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(1)</strong></span> The analysis of growth curve shows that it can be differentiated into three phases:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt="" border="0" height="275" hspace="0" src="http://cdn1.askiitians.com/Images/201472-18342882-7418-growth-curve.jpeg" style="width:250px;height:275px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;border:0px solid black;" title="Growth Curve" vspace="0" width="250"></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(i) Lag phase:</strong></span> It represents initial stages of growth. The rate of growth is very slow in lag phase. More time is needed for little growth in this phase.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(ii) Log phase (Exponential phase):</strong></span> The growth rate becomes maximum and more rapid<strong>.</strong> Physiological activities of cells are at their maximum. The log phase is also referred to as <strong>grand period of growth</strong>.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#000000;">(iii) Final steady state (Stationary phase) or Adult phase:</span> </strong>When the nutrients become limiting, growth slows down, so physiological activities of cells also slows down. This phase is indicated by the maturity of growth system. The rate of growth can be measured by an increase in size or area of an organ of plant like leaf, flower, fruit etc. The rate of growth is called efficiency index.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(2)</strong> P<strong>hytohormones:-</strong></span></p>

<p>(i) Growth hormones also called <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>phytohormones</strong></span></p>

<p>(ii) Term given by Thimann (1948),</p>

<p>(iii) It can be defined as &lsquo;the organic substances which are synthesized in minute quantities in one part of the plant body and transported to another part where they influence specific physiological processes&rsquo;.</p>

<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Growth Hormones and Growth Regulators</strong></span></h2>

<h3><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(1) Auxins:</strong></span></h3>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(i)</strong></span> Auxins (Gk. <em>auxein</em> = to grow) are weakly acidic growth hormones having an unsaturated ring structure and capable of promoting cell elongation, especially of shoots (more pronounced in decapitated shoots and shoot segments) at a concentration of less than 100 <em>ppm</em> which is inhibitory to the roots. Among the growth regulators, auxins were the first to be discovered.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(ii) Types of auxins: </strong></span>&nbsp;There are two major categories of auxins natural auxins and synthetic auxins:</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(a) Natural auxins:</strong></span> These are naturally occurring auxins in plants and therefore, regarded as <strong>phytohormones</strong>. Indole 3-acetic acid (IAA) is the best known and universal auxin. It is found in all plants and fungi.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#000000;">(b) Synthetic auxins:</span> </strong>These are synthetic compounds which cause various physiological responses common to IAA. Some of the important synthetic auxins are 2, 4-D (2, 4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid) is the weedicide. IBA is both natural and synthetic auxin.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(iii) Functions of auxins:</strong></span> Auxins control several kinds of plant growth processes. These are as follows:</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(a) Cell elongation: </strong></span>Auxins promote elongations and growth of stems and roots and enlargement of many fruits by stimulating elongation of cells in all directions.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(b) Apical dominance:</strong></span> In many plants, the apical bud grows and the lower axillary buds are suppressed. Removal of apical bud results in the growth of lower buds. The auxin (IAA) of the terminal bud inhibits the growth of lateral buds. This phenomenon is known as apical dominance.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(c) Weed control:</strong></span> Weeds are undesirable in a field with a crop. By the spray of 2, 4-D, broad-leaved weeds can be destroyed but 2, 4-D does not affect mature monocotyledonous plants.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(d) Root differentiation</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(e) Control of lodging</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(f) Parthenocarpy:</strong></span> Parthenocarpy can be induced by application of IAA in a paste form to the stigma of a flower or by spraying the flowers with a dilute solution of IAA.</p>

<h3><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(2) Gibberellins:</strong></span></h3>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(i)</strong></span> Gibberellins are weakly acidic hormones having gibbane ring structure which cause cell elongation of intact plants in general and increased internodal length of genetically dwarfed plants (i.e., corn, pea) in particular.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(ii) Functions of gibberellin</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(a) Stem elongation:</strong></span> The gibberellins induce elongation of the internodes.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(b) Leaf expansion:</strong></span> In many plants leaves become broader and elongated when treated with gibberellic acid.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(c) Reversal of dwarfism:</strong></span> One of the most striking effects of gibberellins is the elongation of genetic dwarf (mutant) varieties of plants like corn and pea.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(d) Bolting and Flowering:</strong></span> Gibberellins induce stem elongation in &lsquo;rosette plants&rsquo; e.g., cabbage, henbane, etc. Such plants show retarded internodal growth and profuse leaf development. In these plants just prior to the reproductive phase, the internodes elongate enormously causing a marked increase in stem height. This is called bolting.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(e) Enzyme formation:</strong></span> One of the most dramatic effects of GA is its induction of hydrolytic enzymes in the aleurone layer of endosperm of germinating barley seeds and cereal grains. GA stimulates the production of digestive enzymes like proteases, a-amylases, lipases which help to mobilise stored nutrients.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#000000;">(f) Breaking of dormancy:</span> </strong>Gibberellins overcome the natural dormancy of buds, tubers, seeds, etc. and allow then to grow. In this function, gibberellins act antagonistically to abscisic acid (ABA).</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#000000;">(g) Parthenocarpy:</span> </strong>Gibberellins have been considered to be more effective than auxins for inducing parthenocarpy in fruits like apple, tomato and pear. GA application has also resulted in the production of large fruits and bunch length in seedless grapes.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(h) Sex expression:</strong></span> Gibberellins control sex expression in certain plants. In general, gibberellin promotes the formation of male flowers either in place of female flowers in monoecious plants such as cucurbits or in genetically female plants like <em>Cannabis, Cucumis</em>.</p>

<h3><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(3) Cytokinins (Phytokinins):</strong></span></h3>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(i)</strong></span> Cytokinins are plant growth hormones which are basic in nature, either aminopurine or phenyl urea derivatives that promote cell division (cytokinesis) either alone or in conjugation with auxin.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(ii) Functions of cytokinins</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(a) Cell division:</strong></span> Cytokinins are essential for cytokinesis and thus promote cell division. In presence of auxin, cytokinins stimulate cell division even in non-meristematic tissues.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(b) Cell enlargement and Differentiation:</strong></span> Under some conditions cytokinins enhance the expansion of leaf cells in leaf discs and cotyledons. These cells considered to be mature and under normal conditions do not expand.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(c) Delay in senescence:</strong></span> Cytokinin delay the senescence (ageing) of leaves and other organs by controlling protein synthesis and mobilization of resources (Disappearance of chlorophyll). It is called Richmond Lang effect.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(d) Counteraction of apical dominance: </strong></span>Auxins and cytokinins act antagonistically in the control of apical dominance. Auxins are responsible for stimulating growth of apical bud.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(e) Breaking of dormancy:</strong></span> Cytokinins breaks seeds dormancy of various types and thus help in their germination.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(f)&nbsp; Accumulation and Translocation of solutes</strong></span></p>

<h3><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(4) Ethylene:</strong></span></h3>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(i)</strong></span> Ethylene is a gaseous hormone which stimulates transverse growth but retards the longitudinal one.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(ii) Functions of ethylene </strong></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#000000;">(a) Fruit growth and Ripening:</span> </strong>Ethylene promotes fruit growth and its ripening. The harmone is used in the artificial ripening of climacteric fruits (e.g., Apple, Banana, and Mango).</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(b) Transverse growth: </strong></span>Ethylene inhibits longitudinal growth but stimulates transverse growth so that stem looks swollen.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(c) Epinasty (leaf bending):</strong></span> Epinasty represents more growth on upper surface of leaf than on lower surface. Epinasty is said to be controlled by ethylene in many plants.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(d) Abscission: </strong></span>Ethylene stimulates formation of abscission zone in leaves, flowers and fruits.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(e) Apical dominance: </strong></span>Ethylene inhibits the growth of lateral buds and thus causes apical dominance (in pea). It is believed that auxin might be functioning partly through synthesis of ethylene in causing apical dominance.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(f) Root initiation:</strong></span> In low concentration, ethylene stimulates root initiation and growth of lateral roots and root hair.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(g) <strong>Flowering:</strong> </span>Ethylene stimulates flowering in pineapple and related plants though in other cases, the hormone causes fading of flowers.</p>

<h3><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(5) Abscisic acid (ABA):</strong></span></h3>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(i) </strong></span>Abscisic acid is a mildly acidic growth hormone, which functions as a general growth inhibitor by counteracting other hormones (auxin, gibberellins, cytokinins) or reactions mediated by them.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(ii) Functions of abscisic acid</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(a) Control:</strong></span> It keeps growth under check by counter acting the effect of growth promoting hormones, i.e., auxins, cytokinins and gibberellins. As growth is primarily controlled by gibberellins, abscisic acid is popularly called antigibberellic hormone.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(b) Dormancy: </strong></span>Abscisic acid acts as growth inhibitor and induces dormancy of buds towards the approach of winter.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(c) Abscission:</strong></span> ABA promotes the abscission of leaves, flowers and fruits in plants.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(d) Senescence:</strong></span> Abscisic acid stimulates senescence of leaves by causing destruction of chlorophyll (an effect opposite to that of cytokinins) and inhibition of protein and RNA synthesis.</p>
