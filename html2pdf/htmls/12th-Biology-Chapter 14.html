<p>(1) The vast array of species of micro-organisms, algae, fungi, plants and animals occurring on the earth either in the terrestrial or aquatic habitats and the ecological complexes of which they are a part.<br>
(2) Diversity ranges from macromolecules to biomes.<br>
<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(3) Biodiversity on earth exists in three levels of organization:</strong></span><br>
(i) Genetic diversity</p>

<p>(ii) Species diversity&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(4) Genetic diversity</strong></span></p>

<p>(i) It is related to the variations of genes within species.</p>

<p>(ii) The variations may be in different variants of same genes (alleles), in entire genes or in chromosomal structures.<br>
(ii) Greater the genetic diversity among organisms of a species, more sustenance it has against environmental perturbations.<br>
(iii) Genetically uniform populations are highly prone to diseases.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(5) Species diversity</strong></span><br>
(i) it is related to the variety of species within a region.<br>
(ii) Species richness refers to the number of species per unit area.<br>
(iii) Species Evenness refers to the relative abundance with which each species is represented in an area.</p>

<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Biodiversity in India</strong></span></h2>

<p>(1) Out of the twelve mega biodiversity counties, India is one.</p>

<p>(2) India has 10 biogeographical regions, 89 national parks, 500 wild life sanctuaries, 14 biosphere reserves, 6 westlands and 35 world heritage sites.</p>

<p>(3) There are about 45,000 species of plants and about 90,000-1,00,000 species of animals.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt="" src="http://cdn1.askiitians.com/cms-content/revision-notesbiologybiodiversity-and-conservation_0.jpg" title="Endemism in India"></p>

<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Patterns of Biodiversity</strong></span></h2>

<p>(1) Biodiversity changes with change in<span style="color:#000000;"> <strong>latitude</strong> or <strong>altitude. </strong></span></p>

<p>(2) It is minimum at the poles and maximum near or at equator. Similarly, as one moves down from higher to lower altitudes, biodiversity is increased.</p>

<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Loss of bio-diversity:</strong></span></h2>

<p>(1) Caused by three factors - Population, Urbanisation and Industrialisation.</p>

<p>(2) The colonisation of tropical Pacific Islands by human has led to the extinction of more than 2000 species of native birds.</p>

<p>(3) Loss of bio-diversity in a region leads to:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) decrease in plant production.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) less resistance to environmental disturbances such as droughts.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) increase in variability in ecosystem processes like plant productivity, water use, pest and disease cycles etc.</p>

<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Biodiversity Conservation</strong></span></h2>

<h3><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>In situ conservation</strong></span></h3>

<p>(1) The most appropriate method to maintain species of wild animals and plants in their natural habitats. This approach includes conservation and protection of the total ecosystems and its biodiversity through a network of protected areas.</p>

<p>(2) The common natural habitats (protected areas) that have been set for in-situ conservation of wild animals and plants include:</p>

<p>(i) National parks</p>

<p>(ii) Wild life sanctuaries</p>

<p>(iii) Biosphere reserves</p>

<p>(iv) Several wetlands, mangroves and coral reefs.</p>

<p>(v) Sacred grooves and lakes.</p>

<p>(3) Hot spot of biodiversity are those regions of rich biodiversity which have been declared sensitive due to direct or indirect interference of human activities.</p>

<p>(4) There are 25 terrestrial hot spots in the world including two from India.</p>

<h3><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ex situ conservation&nbsp;</strong></span></h3>

<p>(1) Threatened animals and plants are taken out from their natural habitat and placed in special setting where they can be protected and given special care.</p>

<p>(2) Ex situ conservation includes the following:</p>

<p>(i) Sacred plants and home gardens</p>

<p>(ii) Seed banks, field gene banks, cryopreservation.</p>

<p>(iii) Botanical gardens, Arborata, Zoological gardens, Aquaria.</p>

<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Convention on Biodiversity:</strong></span></h2>

<p>(1) &ldquo;The earth Summit&rdquo; held in Rio de Jeneiro in 1992 called upon all nations to take appropriate measures for conservation of biodiversity and sustainable utilization of its benefits.</p>

<p>(2) Second international Conference on Sustainable development held in 2002 in Johannesburg, South Africa, 190 countries pledged their commitment to achieve by 2010 a significant reduction in the current rate of biodiversity loss at global, regional and local level.</p>
