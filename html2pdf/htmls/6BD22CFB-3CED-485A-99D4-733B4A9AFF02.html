<h1><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>EAMCET Syllabus: Topics you need to cover</strong></span></h1>
</div>

<p><strong>EAMCET syllabus</strong> is strictly in accordance with the Board of Intermediate Examination of Andhra Pradesh (equivalent to 10+2). Thus, to prepare for EAMCET, you should cover topics covered in the Ist year (equivalent to Class 11) and IInd year (equivalent to Class 12) quite well.</p>

<p>Paying attention to your studies at school is the key to crack EAMCET too.</p>

<p><strong>EAMCET syllabus </strong>just specifies the scope of subjects and should not be considered exhaustive. For <strong>EAMCET 2014, </strong>there is a chance that questions may be asked not only to test the subject knowledge of students but also intelligent understanding and application of the concepts.</p>

<p>Here is the latest <strong>EAMCET syllabus </strong>prescribed for engineering aspirants:</p>
