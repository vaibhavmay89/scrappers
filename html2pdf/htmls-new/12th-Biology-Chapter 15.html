<p>1) Environmental pollution means the contamination of air, water and land. It is a serious problem of the industralised nations.</p>

<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(2) Air Pollution:</strong></span></h2>

<p><img align="right" alt="" border="0" height="230" hspace="0" src="file:///D:/scrappers/html2pdf/htmls-new/images/2014813-145450670-6684-Pollution-Effects.jpg" style="width:319px;height:230px;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;float:right;border:0px solid black;" title="Air Pollution" vspace="0" width="319">Air pollution refers to the undesirable change occurring in air causing harmful effects on man and domesticated species.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(i) </span><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Air Pollutants :</span> </strong>The common air pollutants are : Dust, Smoke, Carbon monoxide (<em>CO</em>), Ammonia (<em>NH</em><sub>3</sub>), Sulphur dioxide (<em>SO</em><sub>2</sub>), Hydrogen sulphide (<em>H</em><sub>2</sub><em>S</em>), Nitrogen dioxide (<em>NO</em><sub>2</sub>), Hydrogen cyanide, Hydrogen fluorides, Chlorines, Phosgenes, Arsines, Aldehydes, Ozone, Ionising and radiations. <em>CO</em><sub>2 </sub>is not a normal air pollutant. There is 0.03% <em>CO</em><sub>2</sub> in the air its higher percentage is the cause of green house effect.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Types of air pollutants:</strong></span> It is two types:</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(a) </span><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Primary air pollutants:</span> </strong>Air is polluted by poisonous gases and undesirable substances. They are released by burning fossil fuels. These substances are called primary air pollutants. The primary air pollutants are the following:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Soot released from unburned fuel.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Sulphur dioxide (<em>SO</em><sub>2</sub>).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Benzopyrene (hydrocarbon) released from cigarette smoke.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Ammonia (<em>NH</em><sub>3</sub>).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Oxides of nitrogen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Carbon monoxide (<em>CO</em>).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Lead (<em>Pb</em>).</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(b) <strong>Secondary air pollutants: </strong></span>Secondary air pollutants are poisonous substance formed from primary air pollutants. In bright sun light nitrogen, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons and <em>O</em><sub>2</sub> interact to produce more powerful photochemical oxidants like ozone (<em>O</em><sub>3</sub>), peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), aldehydes, sulphuric acid, peroxides, etc. All these constitute photochemical smog, which retard photosynthesis in plants.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(ii) <strong>Causes of air pollution</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(a) <strong>Agriculture:</strong></span> Hydrocarbons released by plants, pollen grains, insectisides etc. cause air pollution.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(b) </span><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Dust:</span> </strong>Dust in the air is increased by dust storms wind, volcanoes, automobiles, etc.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(c) </span><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Industries</span>: </strong>Combustion of fossil fuels like coal, petroleum, etc. Industrial smoke is the main source of pollution.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(d) <strong>Automobiles: </strong></span>The combustion of petrol and diesel in automobiles releases harmful gases into the air. They also produce dust.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(e) </span><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Ionising radiations:</span> </strong>Ionizing radiations include alpha particles, beta particles and gamma rays. They are released into the air on testing atomic weapons.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(f) <strong>Freons: </strong></span>Use of freons and other chloro-fluoro-carbon compounds in refrigerants, coolants and as filling agents in aerosol also cause pollution.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(g) </span><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Aerosols:</span> </strong>Aerosols are small particles of all sorts of solid or liquid substances suspended in the air. They block the stomata of plants and prevent the gaseous exchanges between plants and atmosphere. They may also change the climate of an area.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(iv) <strong>Control of air pollution&nbsp; </strong></span></p>

<p>(a) The emission of exhaust from automobiles can be reduced by devices such as positive crankcase ventilation valve and catalytic converter.</p>

<p>(b) Electrostatic precipitators can reduce smoke and dust from industries.</p>

<p>(c) Gaseous pollutants arising from industries can be removed by differential solubility of gases in water.</p>

<p>(d) A finepray of water in the device called scrubber can separate many gases like <em>NH</em><sub>3</sub>, <em>SO</em><sub>2</sub>, etc. from the emitted exhaust.</p>

<p>(e) Certain gases can be removed by filtration or absorption through activated charcoal.</p>

<p>(f) Certain gases can be made chemically intert by chemical conversion.</p>

<p>(g) At the Government level pollution can be controlled by framing legislations.</p>

<p>(h) Vehicles based on compressed natural gas (CNG) should be introduced.</p>

<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(3) Water Pollution:</strong></span></h2>

<p><img height="213" src="file:///D:/scrappers/html2pdf/htmls-new/images/2014813-145511378-7536-water-pol.jpg" style="margin: 5px; float: right;" title="Water Pollution" width="311">Water pollution refers to the undesirable change occurring in water which harmfully affect the life activities of man and domesticated species.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(i) </span><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Water Pollutants:</span> </strong>The common water pollutants are : Domestic sewage, Industrial effluents, Pesticides,&nbsp; Herbicides, Fertilizers, Bacteria and Viruses, Plankton blooms and Heavy metals like Mercury, Temperature, Silt, Radioactivity, Oils etc.</p>

<p>(ii)<span style="color:#000000;"> <strong>Causes of water pollution&nbsp; </strong></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(a) <strong>Domestic sewage: </strong></span>Domestic sewage consists of human faces, urine, and the dirty used&ndash;up water in houses. It contains a large number of bacteria and virus. The sewage is released into the rivers on the banks of which most of the cities are situated.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(b) <strong>Industrial effluents: </strong></span>All industrial plants produce some organic and inorganic chemical wastes. Those nonusable chemical are dumped in water as a means of getting rid of them. The industrial wastes include heavy metals (<em>Hg, Cu</em>, lead, zinc etc), Detergents, Petroleum, Acids, Alkalies, Phenols, Carbonates, Alcoholcyanides, Arsenic, Chlorine, etc.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(c) </span><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Thermal pollution:</span> </strong>Many industries use water for cooling. The resultant warm water is discharged into rivers. This brings about thermal pollution.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(d) </span><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Agricultural pollution:</span> </strong>The fertilizers used for crops are washed into ponds and rivers.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(e) </span><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Pesticides</span>: </strong>Pesticides are used to control pests in fields and houses. They include DDT, BHC, endrin etc.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(f) </span><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Radioactive wastes:</span> </strong>Liquid radioactive wastes are released into the sea around nuclear installations. The oceanic currents carry the radioactive contaminants everywhere.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(g) </span><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Oil pollution:</span> </strong>Oil is a source of pollution in sea-water. Oil pollution is due to ship accidents, loading and discharging of oil at the harbour, oil refineries and off-shore oil production. Degree of impurity of after due to organic matter is measured in terms of BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand). It is the demand for <em>O</em><sub>2</sub> to decompose organic wastes in liter of water.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(h) </span><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Eutrophication:</span> </strong>Rich growth of micro-organisms consumes most of the dissolved oxygen, so as to depreve other organisms. It generally occurs at the bottom layers of deep lakes. Addition of excessive plant nutrients intensifies eutrophication. It is harmful to fish and other aquatic life.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(iii) </span><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Control of water pollution:</span> </strong>Pollution control by sewage treatment includes the following steps:</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(a) <strong>Sedimentation: </strong></span>When sewage is allowed to stand, the suspended particles settle to the bottom. So by sedimentation the suspended particles are removed from sewage.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(b) <strong>Dilution: </strong></span>The sewage can be diluted with water. This increases the <em>O</em><sub>2</sub> contents and reduces BOD and <em>CO</em><sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(c) </span><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Storage:</span> </strong>The diluted sewage is stored in a pond. This facilitates the growth of micro-organisms. This renders further oxidation of sewage.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(4) <strong>Land pollution: </strong></span>The undesirable change in the land that harmfully affect the life activities is called land pollution.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(i) <strong>Land pollutants: </strong></span>Manure, crop&ndash;residues, ashes, cinders (pieces of coal), garbage (waste food), paper, card board and plastics. Plastics are the most important land pollutants.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(ii) </span><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Pesticides:</span> </strong>Pesticides are chemicals used to kill pests like insects, rats, snails, fungi, herbs, etc. They are collectively called biocides because they kill life.</p>

<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(4) Radioactive pollution:</strong></span></h2>

<p><img src="file:///D:/scrappers/html2pdf/htmls-new/images/2014813-15119279-4594-radioactive.jpg" style="margin: 5px; float: right;" title="Radioactive Pollution">This pollution occurs through radiations. Radiations are of two types:</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(i)</span><strong><span style="color:#000000;"> Non ionising radiations:</span> </strong>UV rays, IR rays, etc. UV rays cause skin burning, IR rays increases atmospheric temperature and leads to the green house effect.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(ii)</span><strong><span style="color:#000000;"> Ionising radiation:</span> </strong><em>X &ndash;</em> rays, x-rays, beta-rays, gamma-rays cause genetic injury on mutation.</p>

<p>Certain elements continuously disintegrate by emitting ionizing radiations. These elements are called radioactive isotopes. Ecologically important radioactive elements are Strontium-90, Argon-41, Iodin-131, Cobalt-60, Cesium &ndash; 137, Plutonium &ndash; 238, etc. Among these Sr-90&#39; is the most dangerous radioactive pollutant.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(i) </span><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Types of ionizing radiations</span>:</strong> Radioactive isotopes release three types of radiations:</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(a) <strong>Alpha particles:</strong> </span>These are large particles emitted by radioactive isotopes (as U<sup>238</sup>). They travel only short distances. They cannot penetrate the organisms. They cause ionization.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(b) <strong>Beta particles:</strong></span> These are small particles emitted by radioactive isotopes. They can travel long distances. They can easily penetrate the body tissues and cause ionization.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(c) <strong>Gamma rays:</strong> </span>These are short wavelength rays emitted by radioactive isotopes. They can travel long distances. They can easily penetrate the body tissues and cause ionization. On the basis of the biological effects produced, the radioactive radiations can be grouped into two types, namely internal emitters and external emitters.</p>

<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(5) Noise pollution</strong></span></h2>

<p>(i) Noise pollution is the result of modern industrialized urban life. It impairs the power of hearing as well as the general health of man.</p>

<p>(ii) It can be controlled by installing noise sources away from residential areas, restricting the use of public address systems, improving machinery and running it in sound proof chambers.</p>

<p>(iii) Occupational exposure to noise can be reduced by using ear muffs or cotton plugs.</p>

<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Global Warming</strong></span></h2>

<p>Increase in atmospheric concentrations of green house gases (CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, CFCs, N<sub>2</sub>O) causes <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>global warming</strong></span> (enhanced green house effect), changes in sea level, weather and climate change etc.</p>
