<p><span style="color:#000000;">Change is the only constant. This is true even for the</span> <a href="http://www.askiitians.com/iit-jee/main/counselling.html">counselling process for JEE Main 2014</a> <span style="color:#000000;">which has seen a few important changes as opposed to the last year. With an aim to make the counselling and admission process candidate friendly and to reduce the apprehensions and inconvenience associated with admissions, these changes have been introduced.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">This year&rsquo;s online counselling process involves four steps of seat allotment in comparison to three rounds last year. Post the completion of the fourth step, spot admission round will follow.&nbsp; This alteration will help in minimizing the gap between the date of completion of counselling process and the date of starting of classes.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">Moreover, there is a facility for those candidates who could not register before the first round to register themselves before the fourth and spot round. Candidates will be required to pay the initial fees through electronic fee payment system only i.e. e-challan, netbanking, credit/ debit card etc. Candidates can choose the bank for initial fees payment as per their convenience.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">To further facilitate the counselling process, many Reporting / Help Centres have been set up throughout the nation. Candidates can choose the Reporting/Help Centre as per their convenience.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">Apart from these, effort is being made to provide a multi-lingual online web/power point/youtube based tutorial to explain the online process to the students. This will help the eligible candidates to make use of the online process efficiently.&nbsp;</span></p>
