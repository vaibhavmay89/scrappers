<p><strong>19)</strong>&nbsp;A student measures the focal length of a convex lens by putting an object pin at a distance 'u' from the lens and measuring the distance 'v' of the image pin. The graph between 'u' and 'v' plotted by the student should look like</p>

<p><strong>20)</strong>&nbsp;Consider a block of conducting material of resistivity '&rho;' shown in the figure. Current 'I' enters at 'A' and leaves from 'D'. We apply superposition principal to find voltage '&Delta;V' developed between 'B' and 'C' . The calculation is done in the following steps:<br />(i) Take current 'I' entering from 'A' and assume it to spread over a hemispherical surface in the block.&nbsp;<br />(ii) Calculate field E(r) at distance 'r' from A by using Ohm's law E = &rho; j , where 'j' is the current per unit area at 'r'.&nbsp;<br />(iii) From the 'r' dependence of E(r), obtain the potential V(r) at 'r'&nbsp;<br />(iv) Repeat (i), (ii) and (iii) for current 'I' leaving 'D' and superpose results for 'A' and 'D'.</p>
