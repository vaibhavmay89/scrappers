<p>Rupanshu Ganvir, a resident of Nagpur, wins <a href="http://www.askiitians.com/olympiads/physics/">silver medal for India at the International Physics Olympiad</a> held at Kazakhstan. This event was held a week ago and the results were declared on Sunday. The young lad has also secured admission to the computer science branch at IIT-Powai after his outstanding performance in the <a href="http://www.askiitians.com/iit-jee/advanced/">Joint Entrance Exam (JEE)</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;Rupanshu has always been an exceptional kid. Usually students are found to be good in say JEE but not in Olympiads and vice-versa. Not only did Rupanshu excelled in both, he also had an excellent command over all the three subjects- physics, chemistry and mathematics. He took part in <a href="http://www.askiitians.com/olympiads.aspx">Olympiads of all the subjects</a> and I kept on encouraging him. It is an extremely proud moment for me and for the nation&rdquo;, said SarangUpganlawar, director of a coaching centre where Rupanshu had been studying for almost three years.</p>

<p>Along with four other team members, Rupanshu was training at a special camp at the Homi Baba centre in Mumbai since July 1 for two weeks. Post the training,the team left for Kazakhstan. Fierce competition from international teams certainly tests the best of performers and hence bagging the silver medal for India is a big achievement for Rupanshu.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rupanshu&rsquo;s proud father Suraj Ganvirsaid, &quot;It is a great moment for us and now I am waiting for his arrival back to India. He has studied very hard for the last two years and was perfectly balancing his preparation for board exams, JEE and Olympiads. He qualified for physics and maths Olympiads at the national level, which I believe had a positive effect on his JEE preparations.</p>
