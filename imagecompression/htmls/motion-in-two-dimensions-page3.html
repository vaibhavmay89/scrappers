<h1><span style="font-size: large;">Motion in Two Dimensions</span></h1>
<p><span>We start with the first point that whenever we speak of any motion it should be with respect to some fixed frame of reference. So, when we see the moon moving. It is not with certainly one can point out that in the night when it looked stationary there were no clouds. So it is an effect of the clouds. The fact is that if we have clouds in some nights moving towards west or east then we see moon travelling towards east or west in the sky respectively. How to explain it with the help of reference frames? It is like this. When we see two objects in the sky one moon and other a cloud, then due to relatively bigger size of clouds (as seen by us) one gets his eyes fixed on clouds and therefore frame of reference gets fixed on the clouds (Figure shown above). It is equivalent to say that we are sitting on the clouds itself, which looks stationary to us and the feeling comes, as if moon is travelling across this stationary cloud in the opposite direction to the clods motion (see figure given above). Similarly, we see things going backwards when we travel on a road.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="../../iit-jee-physics/mechanics/images/moon-in-the-night-sky.JPG" alt="moon-in-the-night-sky" /></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now let us deliberately fix our eyes on the moon and see. What we are doing now is that we are fixing frame of reference on the moon. It is equivalent to say that we are sitting on the moon to observe the cloud's motion and now we can see clouds drifting away (which is the fact). See Figure shown above.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An important observation to remember is that once we choose an object as a frame of reference, we can't see it moving with respect to itself. Naturally, in most of the cases of observations the Earth becomes a natural choice for the reference frame. Also, based on the choice of reference frames one can have many apparent motion of an object under consideration.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here one important point to be noted is that in all previous discussion we have assumed that the reference frames are not accelerating, which means it's acceleration is zero. These are called inertial or unaccelerated frames of reference. Now obviously, we are left with one more choice of class of reference frames that is the accelerated ones. These are called&nbsp;<br />non-inertial or accelerated frame of reference. But in all the forthcoming exercises in this chapter we shall deal with and look only for inertial frames of reference.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Relative motion</strong></span></h2>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider a observer S is fixed to the earth. The other observer S' is moving on the earth, say a passenger sitting on a bus. Hence other frame of reference S' is fixed with bus. Each observer is studying the motion of a cyclist in his or her own frame of reference. Each observer will record a displacement, velocity and acceleration for the cyclist measured relative to his reference frame. Now the question is "How will we compare their results"?. To do this we need the concept of relative motion. Let us do it.<br />&nbsp;</span></p>
