<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Solution:</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">a) H is an oxime HOCH<sub>2</sub>(CHOH)<sub>4</sub>CH = NOH; I is the completely acetylated oxime, AcOCH<sub>2</sub>(CHOAc)<sub>4</sub>CH = NOAc that loses 1 mole of HOAc to form J, AcOCH<sub>2</sub>(CHOAc)<sub>4 </sub>C&ordm;N; K is an aldopentose, HOCH<sub>2</sub>(CHOH)<sub>3</sub>CHO.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">b) The acetates undergo transesterification to give methyl acetate freeing all the sugar OH&rsquo;s. This is followed by reversal of HCN addition.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">c) There is loss of one C from the carbon chain.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">d) Wohl degradation</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">e) The a-CHOH becomes the &ndash;CH = O without any configurational changes of the other chiralcarbons. Thus no epimers are formed.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Question: 2, </strong>a) Show how an aldohexose can be used to synthesize 2-ketohexose. (b) Since glucose is converted to fructose by this method, what can you say about the configurations of C<sup>3</sup>, C<sup>4</sup> and C<sup>5</sup> in the sugars<em>.<br>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">Here aldohexose reacts with one molecule of phenylhyrazine which condenses with the aldehyde group to give phenylhydrazone. When warmed with excess of phenyl hydrazine, the secondary alcoholic group adjacent to the aldehyde group is oxidised by another molecule of phenylhydrazine, to a ketonic group. With this ketonic group, the third molecule of phenylhydrazine condenses to give osazone. The phenylhydrazinyl group is transferred from osazone to C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CHO giving C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CH = N&times;NHC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub> and a dicarbonyl compound called an osone. The more reactive aldehyde group of the osone is reduced, not the less reactive keto group and it gives the 2-ketohexose.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">b) The configurations of these carbons which are unchanged in the reactions, must be identical in order to get the same osazone</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Question:3,&nbsp; </strong>Why should isoelectric point for Aspartic acid (2.98) be so much lower than that of leucine?</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Solution:</strong> This may be explained by considering following ion equilibria</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><img alt="" src="http://cdn1.askiitians.com/Images/201455-122129824-838-Capture.png"></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">It is apparent&nbsp; that ions (A) and (B) are neutral, while (C) is a cation and (D) is dianion. In species (D), the anion is derived from the second &mdash;COOH group present in aspartic acid and is not possible in leucine. At neutral pH a significant concentration of (D), will be present in aqueous solution. It will therefore, be necessary to decrease the pH of such a solution if the formation of (D) is to be suppressed to a stage where anions and cations are present in equal concentration<br>
(the isoelectric point).</span></p>
