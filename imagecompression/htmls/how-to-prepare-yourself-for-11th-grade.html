<p><span style="color:#000000;">Students usually take a back step from studies once they are through with</span> <a href="http://www.askiitians.com/school-exams/cbse/class-10.html">Class 10<sup>th</sup></a>. <span style="color:#000000;">After all of the pressure of the much hyped board exams of class 10<sup>th</sup> and on the way to the</span> <a href="http://www.askiitians.com/school-exams/cbse/class-12.html">12<sup>th</sup> boards</a><span style="color:#000000;">, <strong>11<sup>th</sup> grade </strong>may seem like a welcome change for you. But the difficulty level of class 11<sup>th</sup> will dawn upon you sooner or later. 11<sup>th</sup> is very different in terms of the course content as compared to what you have studied till 10<sup>th</sup>. Difficulty level is higher if you have chosen the science stream as now it is no more general science. <strong>11<sup>th</sup> grade </strong>will teach you concepts of fundamental physics, chemistry, biology, maths etc. And one moment lost could lead to weak basics for the future.<br>
<br>
Roughly, <strong>11th grade</strong> can be considered the advanced class of the 9<sup>th</sup> standard. You will study in depth about the concepts which you have studied in 9<sup>th</sup>, and much more. Similarly, 12th is advanced class of 10th. Like, in 9th, the part of the physics that you studied in science is mechanics. So you will study about it throughout your 11<sup>th</sup> standard. In 12th you will study about electricity and magnetism which you studied in 10th. Thus brush up your knowledge before your begin your classes. Also, in 11<sup>th</sup> you would need to shift your emphasis of study from theories to their application. This would facilitate in your understanding of the topic better as you could relate it to the physical world.<br>
<br>
Chemistry is entirely new in <strong>11th grade</strong>, so is maths except some parts, and Biology is very detailed. Maths is extremely important in 11<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup>. Some of the topics that you need to understand the most are differentiation, integration, geometry and matrices and differential equations. Since you will be preparing for JEE, if you are an aspiring engineer, then you can&rsquo;t neglect maths. It is utmost important as you would need its knowledge for better understanding of physics and chemistry as well. You will study about direct application of these maths topics in other two subjects.<br>
