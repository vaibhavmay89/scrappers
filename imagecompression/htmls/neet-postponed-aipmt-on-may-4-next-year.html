<address><strong><span style="font-size: small;">New Delhi: </span></strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><em>Till now, the news was that All India Pre Medical Test (AIPMT) has been replaced by the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) &ndash;UG for admission to undergraduate medical and dental courses throughout India. However, the Supreme Court has imposed a stay on NEET for next two years. The SC decision has come in the light of various issues related to admission through NEET 2013. As a relief to students, admissions through NEET 2013 will not be affected due to this stay.</em></span></address>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp; <em>As a result, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) will conduct AIPMT in 2014 and 2015. AIPMT 2014 will be conducted on May 4 next year. &nbsp; </em></span><br>
<span style="font-size: medium;"><em>Students should not confuse AIPMT 2014 with earlier versions of AIPMT. It will basically be a duplicate of NEET and hence, students preparing for the common entrance tests (CET) for medical or dental courses will remain unaffected with the change. The only difference between NEET and AIPMT 2014 is that while NEET was planned to be the entrance test for all the seats in medical colleges, AIPMT 2014 is held for only 15% sears in government medical and dental colleges throughout India (except for the states of Andhra Pradesh and Jammu &amp; Kashmir). &nbsp; </em></span><br>
<span style="font-size: medium;"><em>Medical aspirants preparing for AIPMT 2014 should study NEET syllabus and take NEET exam pattern into account. &nbsp; </em></span><br>
<span style="font-size: medium;"><em>Hence, AIPMT 2014 will have a single paper with 180 objective-type questions: </em></span></p>
