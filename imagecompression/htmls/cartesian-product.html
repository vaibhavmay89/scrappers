			<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Let A and B are two non-empty sets. The Cartesian product A &times; B of these sets is defined as the set f all ordered pairs (a, b) such that a &epsilon; A and b &epsilon; B. For example If A = {2, 3. 4} and B = {4, 9, 16} then A &times; B = {(2, 9), (2, 16), (3, 9), (3, 4), (3, 16), (4, 9), (4, 4), (4, 16)}. Out of these ordered paired elements of some are related with each other (In above example the second elements of a bold marked ordered pair is the square of the first. Such ordered pairs are called related ordered pairs.</span></span></p>

			<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">A subset &#39;f&#39; of the Cartesian product A X B is called a function from A to B if and only if to each &#39;a&#39; &epsilon; A, there exists a unique &#39;b&#39; in B such that (a, b) &epsilon; f. Thus the function from A to B can be described as the set of ordered pairs (a, b) such that a &epsilon; A and b &epsilon; B and for each &#39;a&#39; there is a unique &#39;b&#39;. This function may be written as:</span></span></p>

			<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">f : A &rarr; B or A &rarr; B</span></span></p>

			<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Thus, a relation from A to B is a function if and only if</span></span></p>

			<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">(i) To each a &epsilon; A, there exists a unique &#39;b&#39; n B such that (a, b) &epsilon; f</span></span></p>

			<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">(ii) (a<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>1</sub>) &epsilon; f and (a<sub>1</sub>b<sub>2</sub>), &epsilon; f =&gt; b<sub>1</sub> = b<sub>2</sub>.</span></span></p>

			<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Graphically, if f(x) is plotted in the y axis against x and if a line parallel to y axis cuts f(x) at more than one point then f(x) does not fulfill the requirement of a function, because for same value of x, you will have two values of y. (see fig. 1)</span></span></p>

			<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">x = y<sup>2</sup> is not a function, because of x = 4, y = <span style="text-decoration: underline;">+</span>2.</span></span></p>

			<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">e.g. If A = [a, b, c} and B = {d, e, f}</span></span></p>

			<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Then f = {(a, d), (b, d), (c, e)} is a function from A to B but g = {(a, d), (a, e)} is not a function from A to B.</span></span></p>

			<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The unique element b &epsilon; B assigned to a &epsilon; A is called the image of &#39;a&#39; under f for value of f at &#39;a&#39;. &#39;a&#39; is called the pre-image of &#39;b&#39;. Also &#39;a&#39; is called the <strong>independent variable</strong>, and &#39;b&#39; is called the <strong>dependent variable.</strong></span></span></p>
