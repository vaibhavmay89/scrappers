<br><strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A rectangular loop PQRS made from a uniform wire has length a, width b and mass m. It is free to rotate about the arm PQ, which remains hinged along a horizontal line taken as the y-axis (see figure). Take the vertically upward direction as the z-axis. A uniform magnetic field vector B = (3i + 4k) B</span><sub>0</sub><span>&nbsp;exists in the region. The loop is held in the ex-y plane and a current I is passed through it. The loop is now released and is found to stay in the horizontal position in equilibrium.&nbsp;</span><br><br><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><img src="/iit-papers/images/2002/uniform-magnetic-field.jpg" alt="uniform-magnetic-field"><br><br><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the direction of the current I in PQ?&nbsp;</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Find the magnetic force on the arm RS.&nbsp;</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Find the expression for I in terms of B</span><sub>0</sub><span>, a, b and m&nbsp;</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><strong>8.</strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two metallic plates A and B, each of are 5 &times; 10</span><sup>-4</sup><span>&nbsp;m</span><sup>2</sup><span>, are placed parallel to each other at a separation of 1 cm. Plate B carries a positive charge of 33.7 &times; 10</span><sup>-12</sup><span>C. A monochromatic beam of light, with photons of energy 5 eV each, starts falling on plate A at t = 0 so that 10</span><sup>6</sup><span>&nbsp;photons fall on it per square meter per second.

A resistance R and an inductance L are connected to the rails as shown in the figure. A long straight wire carrying a constant current I</span><sub>0</sub><span>&nbsp;is placed in the plane of the rails and perpendicular to them as shown. The bar AB is held at rest at a distance x</span><sub>0</sub><span>&nbsp;from the long wire. At t = 0, it is made to slide on the rails away from the wire. Answer the following questions.&nbsp;</span><br><br><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><img src="/iit-papers/images/2002/inductance.jpg" alt="inductance"><br><br><br><span>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Find a relation among i, di/dt and d&Phi;/dt , where I is the current in the circuit and F is the flux of the magnetic field due to the long wire through the circuit.&nbsp;</span><br><span>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is observed that at time t = T, the metal bar AB is at a distance of 2x</span><sub>0</sub><span>from the long wire and the resistance R carries a current i</span><sub>1</sub><span>.

At a particular instant, when the line OA makes an angle of 45</span><sup>o</sup><span>&nbsp;with the x-axis, a ball is thrown along the surface from the origin O. Its velocity makes an angle f with the x-axis and it hits the trolley.&nbsp;</span><br><br><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><img src="/iit-papers/images/2002/trolley.jpg" alt="trolley"><br><br><br><span>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The motion of the ball is observed from the frame of the trolley.
