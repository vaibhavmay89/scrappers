	<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>CLASS - AMPHIBIA </strong></span></h2>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">Devonian origin &amp; carboniferous is the age of amphibians</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">Class amphibia includes amphibious animals which can live on both the places at ease i.e. under water and on the land. No marine.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">These are the first chordate animals which come out of water but these are not able to live on land permanently, these depend on water for their reproduction. Their eggs do not have protecting covering to check the evoporation.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">Body is divided into head, trunk and tail. Some amphibians lack tail, e.g. frog, toad etc.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">Skin is smooth and mostly scale less, but whenever scales are present there are embeded in the skin e.g. Ichthyophis.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">Numerous glands are found in skin which help in moistening the skin. So these animals respire through moist skin. Some poisonous glands are also found in the skin of some animals e.g. Bufo.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">Pigment cells are also found as chromatophore for colouration. Few amphibians have ability to change colour by expansion and contraction of pigment cells. This phenomenon is known as Metachrosis.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">Two pairs limbs help in swimming in water or moving on land. Forelimbs have four fingers and hindlimbs have five fingers.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">Their digits do not have nails or claws at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">Mouth is bigger in size. Upper or both the jaws have alike teeth. These are pleurodont, homodont and polyphyodont. Suspensorium of jaws is autostylic. (Frog - Acrodont)</span></p>

	<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>CLASS MAMMALIA </strong></span></h2>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">Mammals were evolved in Triassic period of Mesozoic era. Coenozoic era is golden era of mammals.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">Study of mammals is known as Mammology.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Main Characters: </strong></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">The members of this class are cosmopolitan.These are highly developed animals.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">Body is divided into head, neck, trunk and tail.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">A horizontal, diaphragm is present in the body cavity of all the members of this class without any exception.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">This diaphragm is present in between thorax arid abdomen.This helps in respiration, defaecation, micturition arid parturition. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">Their body is covered by a coat of hair (made of a Keratin), called pelage.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">Skin of mammals is thick, water proof, glandular. So many types of glands are present in the skin as sweat glands, oil glands or sebaceous glands and mammary glands.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">Mammary glands (Modified sweat glands) are found in females for baby feeding, so on the basis of this/ the class mammalia was so named.</span></p>
