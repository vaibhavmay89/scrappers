To know whether it is as good exam day strategy for medical aspirants or not, you need to first take a close look at the format of the</span> <strong><a href="/medical-exams/aipmt/" target="_blank">All India Medical Entrance Exam 2014</a></strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="color:#000000;">Total number of questions that will be asked in</span> <strong><a href="/medical-exams/aipmt/previous-year-question-papers.html">AIPMT question papers</a></strong> <span style="color:#000000;">are 180 which are distributed across sections in the following manner:</span>

	<ul>
		<li><span style="color:#000000;">Physics - 45</span></li>
		<li><span style="color:#000000;">Chemistry - 45</span></li>
		<li><span style="color:#000000;">Biology - 90</span></li>
		<li><span style="color:#000000;">Type of questions asked in AIPMT is Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) with four options each. Only one option is correct.</span></li>
		<li><span style="color:#000000;">Each question carries four marks.</span></li>
		<li><span style="color:#000000;">There is negative marking in the exam too to discourage guess work. For each incorrect answer, 1 mark is deducted from the total score of a student. No marks are deducted for un-attempted questions.</span></li>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">It does not really matter how you solve AIPMT 2014 MCQs.<strong> </strong>In the end, you will net scores if you choose the right answer for a given question. If you are not able to guess the correct answer to a question, try eliminating the wrong choices for the question.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Understand the fact that if you are guessing an answer out of four options, you have 25% chance to guess the correct answer. If you can eliminate two choices that you know are definitely wrong, you will have a 50% chance to pick up the correct answer.</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>

<h2><span style="color:#000000;">5 Tricks to eliminate options &lsquo;sensibly&rsquo; in AIPMT</span></h2>

<h3><span style="color:#000000;">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Equal distribution of questions among four options</span></h3>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">In any major competitive exam, answers are equally distributed among the four options &ndash; a, b, c and d. So, if you mark all &lsquo;a&rsquo; options as correct, you will have at least 25% correct answers.<br>
It means in AIPMT, there should be 45 questions with &lsquo;a&rsquo; as correct answer, 45 with &lsquo;b&rsquo; as correct answer and so on&hellip;</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">So, at the end of the paper, when you have already solved all the <strong>AIPMT questions </strong>you are sure about, you can quickly count how many a, b, c and d answers you have. If you have already marked 45 &lsquo;a&rsquo;, you can eliminate &lsquo;a&rsquo; as an option for the questions you have not attempted yet.</span></p>

<h3><span style="color:#000000;">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stay away from the extremes</span></h3>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">In questions that have numerical values as the answer, stay away from the highest and lowest numbers. Experience says that in 60% cases, they are not correct.</span></p>

<h3><span style="color:#000000;">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pay attention to units, values first</span></h3>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">Many of the questions can be solved by just looking at the units of the given options. It means that if the answer to a question should have &lsquo;kg/m<sup>2</sup>&rsquo; as the unit, you cannot eliminate all the options which do not mention it.<br>
Here is another tip. Say, in a question Heat or Thermodynamics, the options given are:</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 90&nbsp;<sup>o</sup>F</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;30&nbsp;<sup>o</sup>C</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 90&nbsp;<sup>o</sup>C</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;40&nbsp;<sup>o</sup>C</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">There are high chances that the &lsquo;unit&rsquo; mentioned thrice will be the correct unit. That helps you eliminate one option already &ndash; one with a different unit.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">Note that the value &lsquo;90&rsquo; is mentioned twice. 80% chances are that it will be the correct value to the answer.<br>
So, your option could be &rsquo;90 <sup>o</sup>C&rsquo;.</span></p>

<h3><span style="color:#000000;">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dimensional analysis for Physics questions</span></h3>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">An easy way to eliminate options from weird questions quickly is <strong>dimensional analysis.</strong><br>
For example, in a question where you have to find velocity of an electromagnetic field and the options are given as:</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(a) (2E/B)&nbsp;<sup>1/2</sup></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(b) (2B/E)</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(c)&nbsp; (2E/B)</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(d) (2B/E)&nbsp;<sup>1/2</sup></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">You have to reach the dimension of velocity which is L<sup>1</sup>T<sup>-1</sup>. &nbsp;Now, dimensions of an Electric Field are (M<sup>1</sup>L<sup>1</sup>T<sup>-3</sup>A<sup>-1</sup>), and dimensions of a Magnetic Field are (M<sup>1</sup>L<sup>0</sup>T<sup>-2</sup>A<sup>-1</sup>).<br>
Only E/B can give you the correct dimension. Hence &lsquo;c&rsquo; will be your option.</span></p>

<h3><span style="color:#000000;">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Working backwards and using fundamentals</span></h3>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">For questions related to equations that have simple numbers as answers, working backwards can be a good way to check if an option should be eliminated or not.<br>
You can also use the basics to eliminate options that are definitely wrong. This works quite well in Biology.<br>
For example, you have to choose the feature common in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. The given options are:</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(a) A membrane-bound nucleus</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(b) A cell wall made of cellulose</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(c)&nbsp; Ribosomes</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">(d) Flagella or cilia that contain microtubules</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;">Now, you know that prokaryotic cells don&rsquo;t have a membrane-bound nucleus, so &#39;a&#39; is out. Eukaryotic animal cells don&rsquo;t have a cell wall, so &#39;b&#39; is out.<br>
If you have strong fundamentals, you can keep eliminating the incorrect options until you arrive at the right answer.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
