<p><span><span><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;Using co-ordinate geometry, prove that the three altitudes of any triangle are concurrent.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;C<span>1</span>&nbsp;and C<span>2</span>are two concentric circles, the radius of C<span>2</span>being twice that of C<span>1</span>. From a point P on C2. Tangents PA and PB are drawn to C<span>1</span>. Prove that the centroid of the triangle PAB lies on C<span>1</span>.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;The angle between a pair of tangents drawn from a point P to the parabola y<span>2</span>&nbsp;= 4ax is 45<span>0</span>. Show that the locus of the point P is a hyperbola.</span></span></p>

<p><strong>10.</strong>&nbsp;A curve C has the property that if the tangent drawn at any point P on Cmeet the co-ordinate axes at A and B, then P is the mid-point of AB. The curve passes through the point (1, 1). Determine the equation of the curve.</p>
<p><strong>11.</strong>&nbsp;Three players A, B and C, toss a coin cyclically in that order (that is A, B, C, A, B, C, A, B, &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;) till a head shows. Let p be the probability that the coin shows a head. Let&nbsp;<span><span>a</span></span><span>,&nbsp;</span><span><span>b</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;and y be, respectively, the probability that A, B and C gets the first head. Prov that&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span><span><span>b</span></span>&nbsp;= (1 &ndash; p)&nbsp;<span><span>a</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span>. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Determine&nbsp;<span><span>a</span></span><span>,&nbsp;</span><span><span>b</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;and y (in terms of p).</p>
<p><strong>12.</strong>&nbsp;Prove , by vector methods or otherwise, that the point of intersection of the diagonals of a trapezium lies on the line passing through the mid-points of the parallel sides. (You may assume that the trapezium is not a parallelogram.)</p>
