<h3><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>PROGRAM FOCUS &amp; OBJECTIVES</strong></span></h3>

<p>This is a 278 hours program for 12<sup>th</sup> studying or 12<sup>th&nbsp;</sup>pass students for physics, chemistry and biology subject. The course emphasizes on making the students revisit the fundamental conc<strong>ept</strong>s of Physics, Chemistry &amp; Biology and on sharpening their analytical skills and parallel thinking process which makes them capable of creatively resolving complex&nbsp;and tricky problems by mere application of basic concepts for a quantum jump in their performance in PMT. Each student has the right strategy for himself/herself for&nbsp;TIME MANAGEMENT&nbsp;to ensure optimum output.</p>

<h3><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Teaching Methodology</strong></span></h3>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>The classes will focus on the important topics for PMT.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The course gets started in the month of October completed by February.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Lectures will be based 50% concept revision and 50% doubt removal.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Teaching will focus on important concepts and question solving. Formulae are taught through solved/unsolved examples/illustrations and derivations.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The Discussion part is more of interactive type and students are motivated to raise and discuss their doubts/objections to understand the concepts/fundamentals used in problem solving.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The faculty members follow standardized lecture notes while delivering their lecture. This helps in synchronized teaching in all the batches across the course.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Performance assessment through test papers formulated after analyzing the past 10 years PMT trend.</p>
