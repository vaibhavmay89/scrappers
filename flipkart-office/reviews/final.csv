Superb solved examples.
Bought 5-6 of these for all my friends. 
Couldnt help but wonder in the end the level of difficulty i was able to overcome.....!!!

"THIS BOOK IS FUNDAMENTALLY GOOD.. EVERY TOPIC ON THIS BOOK IS EXPLAINED CLEARLY FROM THE BASIC LEVEL...BUT WHO WANT MANY EXAMPLE..WHO WANT MANY EXERCISE..THIS BOOK IS NOT FOR THAT.. THOUGH IT HAVE SOME ENOUGH EXAMPLES TO CLEAR YOUR IDIEA...."
"It is a basic book for calculus that caters for all basic need to understand calculus with a proper guidance for jee level"
"
 This is the best book for iit jee calcuus.
It guides with a lot of basic concept strenthning concepts
It will enchance ones study knowledge of calculus "
"
 Its a great book!!
The theory is very helpful!!
Just you wished the number off questions and the quality were a little higher!! "
"a god book must for all of them who want to secure good ranks in iit jee i am presently in class 9 but stiil i am very much understanding the concept of calculus thanks to the author vikas rahi. at first i started to understand calculus on you tube and then i finally took the decision to buy a book for calculus as i found that calculus was not that much difficult and hopefully i got the perfect book at first place"
"donot waste ur time reading reviews. go ahead n buy it. ll not regret the descision,i m sure of it. simply great 
if u wanna crck iit, this book is a must.."
"A must for all the Future IItians... Get it n i m sure ll not regret your decision.. I have used it,n would like to suggest u 2 do d same... u can see for yourself how even d toughest of maths can get managable vid ur appropriate selection of resources... its a race boss... which is won by a smart hard work.."
"This book though i haven t gone through all of it is a gem of its kind. This book contains advanced level problems which are very useful for IIT Aspirants etc"
"It looks good at a glance over, but if u are a BSc or MSc student, don t by this one, it contains 12th std, question answer."
"This book really contains an enormous amount of questions related to most of the questions in the chemistry.This may really help you to work upon them."
"
 in most of the physics books u r liable to find the application of calculus right from the 2nd or 3rd chapters.this books gives u every thing reqd. for studying physics without having great depth of maths......
i used it & found it very comfortable....
very useful book.... "
"As I was preparing for my medical examination, I had no idea about complex Maths in Physics. Mathematical Tool was the first chapter in class XI (phy) and my NCERT book was not enough to completely understand the above chapter. This book was of tremendous help! All topics in an elaborated format without any complex concept as used in a PROPER maths book!! JUST TO UNDERSTAND FEW CONCEPTS OF MATHS USED IN PHYSICS!"
"I had taken to brush up the basics but this package is too thin!! not quite useful.better go through the examples of R.S.Aggarwal to get a solid firm idea!"
"Please don t buy this book, it will lead to wastage of money as well as time. No systematic representation, theory, and problems. Worst book i ever bought. Go for the arihant book instead of this. Not good for competition!"
"I bought this book from TMH site. Note that this book is very big and lot of concepts are covered for JEE. There are lot of typos in the book which is irritating. I only solved first 30 pages and already found closely 20+ typos. So beware of this low quality in proof reading if you want to buy this book. If you want to become thorough in algebra solve only these books 1. Hall & Knight 2. Bernard & Child. Period."
"conceptual with proof whereever possible buy and read if you have suffcient time
And if you are short of time than atleast read chapter on Matrices, Complex no. , Permutation and Combination and Probability
Style of teaching is typical Kota style which load you with lot of useless infomation so it is time consuming but once studied thorougly will proove quite helpful"
"Mr Shishir Mittal is an IITian and a teacher of resonance institute kota. This book has detailed theory and tons of examples and illustrations. Each topic of Mole Concept is Clearly Given and then the problems related to it are given in this book. This book is best for an IIT aspirant."
"The book is very well written by the resonance faculty and is very good for preparation of competetion. But the pattern of the book is not good . It has tooo many questions on advanced level and focuses less on base developement."
"I was really disapointed after going through Mole Concept by Shishir Mittal.Because it is published by TMH,with lot of expectations I purchased.Finally....only disppointed by the contents...I personally feel Mole Concept by R.C.Mukarjee better than this."
"
 this book is awesome it has helped me a lot in cracking iit-jee exam. almost 90% of the questions were similar in the exam as in this book. best book in physics for iit-jee aspirants.
it helped me a lot, variety of questions with detailed solutions are also given,which is really fantastic. "
"the book iit master no doubt is a very brilliant book for jee but one thing which strikes me is, this book is same as the 34 year question papers, so NAME BADALNE SE KUCH NAHI HOTA, WE NEED SOMETHING EXTRA. i hope this was helpful"
"TBH, This book is worthless. Stay Away. 
Theory: No use buying this book for even short summary of theory. The book misses out lots of important points in the theory. Even important chapters have very little theory (only about 4-5 pages). 
Questions: No use buying it for the questions either. Hardly 100 questions in each chapter. Soultions are provided to only 30% of the questions. The CD has the same questions that are in the book. CD is useless as well. Has a lame interface. 
*Not at all worth the price tag.* 
Better Buy Arihant s New Pattern AIEEE Chemistry."
"Superb book with solved examples on all typical problems in aieee.
latest syllabus according to aieee.Now taking a look at the Complete Mathematics for aieee 2012.first time ordered a book online & very impressed by Flipkart s superb service"
"I had bought this book back on november 2012 during my class XI on Kerala board(I am currently at XII). I had gone through some pages and i found that it is hard to follow this book. After i had completed my plus one course i had bought HC Verma and so after reading some review and suggestions at some sites. Later i came to know that i was wrong in my decision. I was lacking a proper strategy. My best friend(Namely Mohammed Faiz Saneen guided me well). Now i am pretty addicted to the method used by the auther NK Bajaj to solve many sums. Takes time to click the concepts but if you stick with it and try you maximum solving each and every question you will surely benefit. 
1) Having almost 150 Questions(average) Per chapter. 
2) Solutions for almost all question(Say every questions). 
3) Extensive theory(I would say so) With nice collection of solved examples. Practically there is no need of looking for theory elsewhere. It will take time to understand(Not bad). 
4) Nice pages with nice fonts will make you stick with the book. 
Best of luck and wish me best of luck too......"
"Mathematics is the most feared of the three and requires most practice. This book does the same. A collection of previous year IIT JEE questions is the best one to test your mathematical skills. Again like its physics counterpart, solutions to a few questions are incomplete and absurd but apart from that it is a treat to solve."
"This books gives information about iit jee and the methods to tackle it. It has many tips that can help you to crack iit jee with a ease. This book is worth the money"
"this book is a perfect guide for jee aspirants. this book is above any mentos an unbiased story which takes u through crests and troughs of jee."
"For starters this book is well written and finely conceived. But it has been published taking into mind the Class 11 entrants. So if yo re in 12th or even Half past 11th, It might not prove itself so useful. The writers have an amateur writing style. However, it does give you a few insights on how to prepare yourself- on a self disciplined principle- not getting into the IIT. 
Flipkart s delivery was a dismay this time- They usually deliver books in 36 hours in Kolkata.. This one took 72. 
3.7 Stars would be apt for the piece. (Not considering Flipkart s delivery standards)"
"
 its a good but it is to me bought before class 11
CBSE students can have it during the three months holiday 
remember to follow the tips given in it
the intellectual content makes the author open to you
the tips regarding planning is awesome
i am happy to have it 
flipkart delivery was best as always "
"
 Young school boys must not miss a chance of reading this valuable book while preparing for JEE. It builds self-confidence and ensure their entry to the most prestigious institute of the country. 
Wish best of luck to all the enthusiasts. "
"Many tips can be followed only before class 11. However it still makes an interesting read due to the easy and conversational language. The section on Inorganic chemistry was HIGHLY useful. I plan on using all the tips as soon as I start with inorganic chemistry."
"The book is a must for a JEE aspirant. It builds up the mentality of a student, who is from a locality without any JEE coaching classes. It s a must. 
5 star for the book and flipkart service."
"Good Book for All Aspirants and their Parents.
It guides the students about the approach for the IIT JEE, should be helpful for all aspirants as well as the Parents,"
"Very useful book to crack JEE. I recommend to all Jee Aspirants. All 100 tips are helpful to achieve JEE Rank. Tips for syllabus, revision, for NCERT BOOKS, for Reference books, for concepts, for applications, for calmness , and concentration are also helpful."
"The authors explain the methods they used for success but they have not kept in mind the present trend where the board marks are equally important to crack this exam as we cannot dump the boards completely. Otherwise a good book for those who want to know the basics."
"very helpful for students preparing for iit jee, it makes every concept crystal clear... students want to do good in iit jee must get this book... I have bought this book from flipkart and know my concepts on organic chemistry..."
"THIS BOOK ORDERED BY ME IS GOOD ONE FOR PREPARING IIT-JEE EXAM AND OTHER COMPETITIVE EXAMS. I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ALL STUDENTS WHO ARE WILLING TO GIVE COMPETITIVE EXAMS.BUT FIRST STUDY NCERT AND THEN THIS BOOK."
"
 it has a very detailed theory which is very good but i would say that morrison, solomon would be better
but if u r searching for brief theory and advance level problems(subjective, objective and all other types included) then ranjeet shahi of arihant publications would be the best. "
"Its the classic case of old wine in new bottle . The book is just the normal carey otherwise available without this packaging . Shishir Mittal has just added some questions at end of each chapter with answer keys ( no solutions ) . I couldnt find anything else that makes it the book for IITJEE anymore than it originally was . So good book by carey , OK additions of questions by SM (and good use of his name in kota to push this book by SM) . Your call to go for it or not ."
"
 Practice functions and graphs from this book, its good and comprehensive.
Then you can target objective questions on these topics. "
"
 very good book and approach is very good well organised book....
problem with this book is infinite number of misprints and mistakes...
i think author forget to proofread this book.......
hoping 2nd edition will be free from the misprints......... "
"Great book , I must say.
Great numericals along with concepts.
A must buy for anyone who wants to clear entrance examinations mainly engineering side..."
"a must try for medical and engineering aspirants and mainly because of its question selection and levels made out of questions .Also due to the lucidity of the language that is used to convey the chapters . It is to the point, ranging of questions from numerical problems to assertion and reasoning.the solutions are given for every question with reason as if it is a tutor always by your side. syllabus is according to the board s rules and regulations, setting of questions and introductions are made with competitive exams in mind and are laid with formulas and questions from competitive engineering exams of national and state level."
"Repeated questions, errors - typographical and sometimes factual; the hints and solutions at the end isn t of much help for clearing concepts.
Buy it only if you want more questions to practice (won t be of any help as a reference book.)"
"
 very nice book.. with good type MCQ questions ..... would be a lot of help in competitive exams with objective questions..!!!
it contains many objective questions topic wise and numerical problems at the end of the chapter....!!
it would be a useful book for iit jee for quick reviewing of all topics.....! "
"
 Must Buy for IIT-JEE 
This book is excellent as it provides all the solved examples relevant for IIT-JEE preparation.Once anyone reads the formulae it is very easy to solve the problems.The book provides EXCELLENTLY written theory and is must for those weak at the subject.I would surely recommend this book. "
"full of error.
 most of the answer given the answer key is wrong
it is not possible to check every answer
explanation of question not given in the book"
"THOSE WHO WANTED TO MASTER MECHANICS FOR IIT JEE SHOULD GET IT. THIS IS SUCH A WONDERFUL BOOK IN WHICH CONCEPTS ARE PRESENTED IN A VERY SIMPLE AND LUCID WAY."
"I got 199/360 in JEE(Main) 2014 only with the help of this book without any coaching. This book has very good solved examples & exercises. Totaly this is complete pack."
"This book will be very useful if you are having problems in very questions which requires application of very basic concepts. I would suggest this book for anyone having problems in solving higher level IIT standard question. they must try this book and after that they can move for JEE advanced (TMH), problem plus or ML Khanna"
"contains lots of examples and worked out problems ,it also has a set of unsolved problems .but the only thing is that the theory is not good for understanding"
"If you want to score very high then this is the best book.Absoultely uncommon questions are given.Exactly the same type questions are given which are asked in entrance.After completing this book u will find entrance questions easy."
"This book is a comprehensive guide to JEE mathematics, and NOTHING else is required for success in JEE Mains, BITSAT, etc. I would thoroughly recommend it. Truly a good buy. Flipkart s service, of course, was phenomenal..."
"on my family occasion i have purchased this book... actually i have to go to this wedding and also have to do office work... i just opened browser and linked www.flipkart.com and that s it what i want.... it s very easy to order anything else.... its awsomeness is priceless.... i really appreciate it..."
"Excellent book for practice, but not for theory!!
I bought this from flipkart as it was suggested by our coaching institute and flipkart is the best!! 
Pros 
1. Contains a lot of questions from nearly all the topics for jee main.
2. Detailed explanations of answers are given. 
3. Very easy to understand the answer.
4. Different level questions are given. 
Cons 
1. It is not meant for theory. 
2. Some topics like linear inequalities are not given. 
Would like to recommend to al the aspirants for jee main. But make sure you read theory from some other good book before attempting it!!!"
"1. INFO. ABOUT MAINS
2. SOLVED EXAMPLES
3. GOOD THEORY EXPLANATIONS 
4. MCGRAW HILL , HENCE NO DOUBT THAT IT S BAD...................GOT IT FOR RS 425 BY OFFER....."
"
 Nice quality of material ! 
Calculus is explained very well indeed comparing to ERROR LESS or others. "
"The book is just good........... when u use it in a proper manner with a good concentration and readeblity makes the book worth for money"
"this book covers the latest prescribed syllabus of JEE main. lots of examples are given at the very beginning of each chapter and problems are divided into 2 sections(same as previous books of TMH). But there is one problem in THM s books, i.e., the problems are not properly oriented according to the level. for ex. one should start from easy problems and then would go to medium and harder problems. They should assemble the problems acc. to difficulty level so that one can gain confidence by doing some less difficult problems. Otherwise the book is great to get prepared for JEE mains."
"
 This Book is great to prepare for JEE Main without any guidance. There is point to point theory to understand subject and simple way to practice through MCQs.
You can easily understand the topic quickly than any othor refrences. "
"the book is very exhaustive and covers almost all areas of study. reallly good for Jee mains students . I would recommend this above all other books available in the market."
"Great book. Includes summary of the lessons, tips for solving particular types of problems.Though a few mistakes can be spotted here and there but no big issues, an ideal book for jee main 2014"
"First of all, I am amazed by the superfast flipkart delivery. The book was delivered to me in less than 24hrs on the clock, truly remarkable. 
Coming to the book, The book has ample theory, not much and neither less. It s full of solved examples, which help to build the confidence while ensuring the clarity on concept.
All in all, A must buy and truly better than Arihant."
"the book is very exhaustive and covers almost all areas of study. reallly good for Jee mains students . I would recommend this above all other books available in the market."
"This is a good book for jee mains.it will help you a lot in mcq s. Question practice is more than enough. Buy this book without any doubt"
"Prompt supply. 
Good book for the students aspiring to make a mark in JEE Main. 
But all the student must keep in mind that they should also read the text books."
"Not at all good book.Doesn t have any good theory
Questions are mostly past year iit and aieee questions
The book should be better renamed as past year question bank
Disappointing book!!!please dnt waste your money"
"
 To the point, updated syllabus, far more relevant with latest jee main syllabus and pattern of question. 
A good book for practice and revision. "
"This Book is great to prepare for JEE Main without any guidance. There is point to point theory to understand subject and simple way to practice through MCQs. You can easily understand the topic quickly than any othor refrences"
"
 though book does not provide solutions to all question but the theory an explanations part are so much helpful... good book.. 
 . . "
"A very well written book. Hard work done by VKR shows. Written from the point of view of students preparing for JEE clarifying every little doubts that may creep in the minds of students.
Way to go VKR. Very well written. From the student s point of view, much better than those highly overrated Arihant Books.."
"If you all are interested in Learning and Mastering Basic Mathematics, Its as awesome book that might help you out with.
Esspecially for aspirants for IIT and NEET its a masterpiece !! :D 
Thanks to Flipkart and the Writer !!"
"
 This book truly provides a complete package for physics of jee advanced , every required concepts as well as key formula e are mentioned . Has a lot of questions, especially more than one choice type and integer based questions are worth doing. 
The book also combines previous years questions which makes it more handy. 
To conclude as a revision package it is one of the best in market. "
"this book is good but it would have been great if they followed the kinda presentation & explanation in the way they did for Maths edition"
"nice book... gives the complete idea of the pattern of jee advance paper(iit jee).... covers all types of questions single choice, multiple choice, comprehension type, assertion type, matrix type and even subjective questions... good and quality questions... intro of each and every topic given in the beginning... not waste time like other jee books"
"
 Good theory for revision , but way too easy problems just barely above jee mains level.
Buy some other book if you want to clear jee advanced chemistry. "
"
 this is a good well presented book, all concepts are explained neatly, no long theory.
it only concentrates on the exam ie. Jee advanced "
"no doubt tmh being the best book for jee advanced preparation.it clears all the concepts of physical chemistry,also have good level questions of organic chemistry"
"From its Physics and mathematics counterpart this book seems lacking at first sight in terms of chapter outline , solution quality , theory given . 
As one gets going reading chapters we find ourselves very much through it and when you forget comparison you find that this is what we expect from a book but we do expect a better one from TMH. 
A sure buy for students expecting top ranks."
"
 I had thought this book would be a nice theory book but after using this I have concluded that this book(actually whole series of TMH Comprehensive) is not for learning theory. These books would be helpful only when you have some 3-4 months before jee and you need quick revision and a lot of numericals.
For e.g some important formulas have not been given in Atomic Structure chapter of this book. "
"
 This book is a must for strengthening ur concepts through problems.
This book is enough to help u score good marks in jee and might help u in board exams as well.Very few problems are out of syllabus and are at iit level.If you have this book dont care to buy another book like cengage. concentrate on only one book. the way of representing questions are also good.If you want more harder questions go for GN Berman or Dybov. "
"Please note that if any body is having older version of TMH , this book is also having the same material. So, I purchased this book keeping in mind that TMH amd McGraw Hill is different now, but McGraw hill didn t work upon the problems and copy paste the same book what it was during the past five - seven years, So, if somebody is having an older version like 2010 or so please do not waste money in purchasing on this. 
Sachin Sharmaa"
"Wonderful Book...A Comprehensive Coverage for IIT-Advanced... I personally recommend to stick to any of these big and completely comprehensive guide (only 1) for 1 subject to crack IIT.... And I feel This book is more than enough for Maths...So If you are completing back to back thorough on this book.. You will do it definitely great in Maths for IIT...CBSE will be a piece of cake walk for you!!"
"it s a very good book to start the preparation for iit jee
though the theory is little less but the large number of solved examples counters it
it covers almost all the topics of iit jee with wide range of previous year questions
but i would suggest to 
DEVELOP BASIC CONCEPTS OF TOPICS BY GOING THROUGH CERTAIN GOOD THEORY BOOKS LIKE R.D. SHARMA OR NCERT BEFORE STARTING McGRAW HILLS."
"
 The book is a collection of quite a lot of information and covers most of the topics in Biology, however this isnt an ultimate book for NEET. The scope of the book in some topics seems limited, however there is more than essential in some topics; which is actually good!
It is best suited for someone who has already learnt concepts and seeks to Revise them just in time for an exam.
A coloured edition with eye catching illustrations would have been much better!
The book is in right size and is easy to handle.... "
"
 Thanks for the delivery of book on time but I have lost faith in online shopping because 
 a) when I opened the percel , the book was not in good condition as first four pages are folded and binded , the book will look shabby if I cut those pages. 
b) how can a artical despatched without certifying to be OK. "
"
 ALL CHAPTERS COVERING.
VERY SIMPLE AND UNDERSTANDABLE LANGUAGE.
SYSTEMATICALLY FOLLOWS THE IMPOTANCE OF ALL THE SUBJECT....
ITS VERY WORTH TO BUY THIS BOOK.
THIS IS SIMPLY WORTH FOR THE MANAGEMENT AND ENGINEERING PERSUING STUDENTS. "
"Though it is nothing more than a basic management manual, this book is useful for engineering students to learn management skills...Language is simplified and easy to understand and well illustrated...it covers almost all the topics of management needed in engineering"
"From a parent s viewpoint, I have found this book very useful. 
Students aspiring for tough examinations need equally good book for preparation. Unfortunately, these type of books are numbered. I would surely recommend this book for others."
"IT IS THE BEST BOOK FOR PREPERATION UPTO HIGHEST LABLE. I CONGT THE WRITTER AS WELL AS FLIPCART FOR KEEPING THIS TYPE OF BOOK."
"This is a very useful book, It do not only have MCQ but also given their solutions, Introductions are excellent. I recommend this book to all the students"
"
 i have used iit foundation for class 6. it is excellent. exercises, worked out problems and the introductions are excellent. i like this book very much. i used this book for all competitive exams. i got very good result. thanks for the publications and my spl thanks to authors who wrote and edited this book. i am recommending this book to all my friends and all of them got this book and they also said , it was very useful. 
aarthi of VI std. "
"Its very useful for all Electrical Branch students to brush up your Electrical Engineering basics. Its really worth to have this book as it helps in quick reference of basic topics."
"The book is awesome, there is no other book which can give you iit coaching better than these and of course for your 9th you can take gk publications- iit jee foundation course for 9-10 students. The question bank is great and they have explained everything in detail"
"Got it after long wait. Was not available anywhere. Good for all kinds of competitions. I bought it to teach my niece for aryabhatta exam."
"its a very nice book. it contains all the ncert chapters for boards and extra chapters for competitive exams and training for iit jee, aieee etc. i would recommend buying this publication instead of any other publication of iit foundation"
"its a nice companion with the unsolved exercise and subject detailing...but can be more effective with the inclusion of more never seen before numericals"
"this book is worth reading.if u read this book u will definately develop interest for organic chemistry.its completely for iit entrance."
"Only previous GATE & IES solved questions are given with definitions of some important concepts. 
But Operations Research & Industrial Engineering are just ignored . 
Very few material on such topics. 
If you already have R K Rajput books on each subject then NO NEED TO BUY this one,
since concepts are just copied pasted as they are."
"
 PROBLEMS IN MATHEMATICS is a great book for maths.
the questions in this book hit directly on your concepts. By its size , it may look as a small book, but be prepared to face some boggling questions just as u open this book. 
also, i would like to suggest u to buy this books from flipkart. the delivery speed and the book condition is just impeccable. "
"
 This book is the best book in the market for the elementary level problems. It has a diverse types of questions from almost all branch of elementary mathematics. 
Also flipkart did a great job in delivering this product within 2 days and book and packing was very nice.
I would like to Thank Flipkart for their service... "
"this book doesnt contain so tough questions but very useful for secondary students.though there is no concept problems were very good useful for foundation in elemantary maths"
"it is an amazing book.the books contains good collection of problems.it s very good book for jee aspirants."
"I bought this book expecting more difficult and tricky questions. It turns out to be full of usual practice questions. It s okay for AIEEE level math, nowhere near to IITJEE or Olympiad as I had thought based on previous reviews. 
It s a good one for it s level though."
"This book has a lot of interesting problems ... if you love math they\ re fun to do .The hints aren\ t there for many questions so that\ s a problem, but in some ways that\ s good because you\ ll try harder to get the right answer. A good book for doing a lot of interesting questions in algebra, trigonometry, elementary functions, fundamentals of mathematical analysis, geometry and vector algebra."
"
 This book has plenty of problems which make you re-think about your understanding of Particular topic, Buy it if you want to Recall your concepts in shortest time...
THIS BOOK IS A PROBLEM BOOK i.e. BOOK HAS NO THEORY PORTION "
"
 This book is good
Almost all questions have right answers and cover the topic
It give me quick review on aiims may 2012
About Flipkart, its extraordinary
Within 48 hrs book was delivered
Book: Recommended
Flipkart: Hot Shot "
"
 A wonderful concise book including aiims nov 2012,may 2012 ,nov 2011 & aipg 2012 in subjectwise manner... must do before may aiims 2013.
all the topics are nicely covered With all important stuff high lighted & in easiest possible way to memorise . "
"Explanations are not as detailed as AAA, do for it if u want to keep it short and fast, ideal for last minute"
"The book is helpful as the last edition of AA and MK does not include these question paper.
But the 1 thing that need to be improved is that the answers of all Qs of all papers are jumbled up in subjectwise format. It is very difficult to find answer in the order of flow of questions.., otherwise it might be helpful as it given in subject wise manner so that all Qs related to a particular subject can be read and understood in better way."
"The book is ideal for those who want the necessary content for JEE and yet not miss out the completeness of the original JD Lee. I find it more useful than J D Lee in fact. It has several additional chapters with accurate information. Must have for JEE and other competitive exam aspirants."
"Myself being a student of SUDARSHAN GUHA, suggst evry odr JEE aspirants, dis is d bst 1 for preparin inorganic for JEE.. Sir is an awsum teachr for inorganic.. He taught in the leading KOTA s coachin institute BANSAL CLASSES n presntly teachin in ALLEN CAREER INSTITUTE, KOTA.. 
So for dis book, THUMBS UP... Jst go for it.."
"Not so good theory and is difficult to understand , and the problems aren t enogh...OP Tandon still makes a better option.."
"I have personally finished reading this book, and it contains all the topics for iit chemistry and it is simple to understand as well, so you can go for it without hesitation.There are many at the end problems too, which develop problem solving skill.It is a great marvel by Sudarsan Guha."
"this book questions difficulty level is too high......the question are difficult to solve without basic knowledge and foundations of inorganic chemistry....MY CHOICE IS OP TANDON"
"This book is great for IIT Preparation but it has many demerits to it
- It does not have D-block elements which is excluded from IIt syllabus but in Cbse Board .
- Explanation in Concise is by far better and more elaborate than this 
Now advantages to this book
- Syllabus covered properly
- Written for IIT aspirants
- Contains a good number of chapter practice problems"
"The edits in the book are absolutely up to the mark. The partss that have been removed or edited are perfect for IIT JEE syllabus. 
I would rate it as the top book for any aspirant serious about IIT JEE advanced or about understanding chemistry in general."
"Better than the other version...the writer has removed all contents that were in original jd lee and was not required for jee...and has also added some topics for jee...go for this if u are a student...if u want to learn more than what is required for jee...take the other one"
"The writer is my teacher&he is one of the best teachers of inorganic chemistry in Kota(Rajasthan).the exercises prop is one of the best prob in India for inorganic chemistry.this book is for those who want to get perfection in inorganic chemistry for iitjee outside of Kota."
"
 I really found this book very helpful.! You will have everything which is required as per jee syllabus! Moreover, Its very time saving..as now you dont need to refer the bulky J.D lee! So without any hesitation just go for it you will certainly find it very useful! :) 
It is a great marvel by Sudarsan Guha. "
"this book gives all the answers 100% correct, though the small explanations have not been done,which results it as more better because student need to apply brains to understand the solutions,,not just mugging up the methods..till now i have seen many solutions but this is really good..."
"this book is kind of OK...not very well...explanation is not so easy for 12th & 11th standard students..."
"The solutions are very good. We all know that it is impossible to write down each step of every problem but the problem solving techniques are really mind blowing"
"The book is great for building one s concepts. Every topic has been started from zero level and has been built upto the IITJEE level and covers the full syllabus of IITJEE in a comprehensive way. Each and every reaction given in the book is accompanied with its mechanism and stereochemistry , so if you want to learn reaction mechanisms this is the best book in the market. chapters have many solved examples and exercises are good but the only disadvantage is that all the exercises dont have the answers. But all together it is a great book."
"This book is not worth its investment.Even i bought this book after reading reviews here saying that its an awesome book but the real fact is it is just another piece of shit.Don t go for this book,its waste of time.I have spent hours on this book without having any fruitful result.In my advise dont buy this book instead go for a good organic chem teacher near the area you stay or look at youtube videos of organic chem topics."
"
 In my words, this book contains so much enormous amount of material that may even help you after qualifying IITJEE or any other competitive Exam.
Each topic has special and easily understandable amount of theory and with some examples it makes the topic more interesting.
With that, we have the exceptions included.
If you get a grab of this book and get through with this one, I am sure you will be having a good amount of knowledge regarding topics in organic chemistry. "
"Fantastic book
 it clears al ur concepts on IIT level organic chemistry.
 Defi n tly a student score good marks after reading this.
 One shud must buy this book.
 With this buk u shud also prefr M.S. Chauhan s practice buk."
"I found this book to be written in very simple and clear language. It takes us from basic to the highest level.Concepts are explained very nicely and i think unnecessary things are not there.But my advice would be to first study ncert properly and then go for this .Although this book takes us to the highest leve but i think some of the topics like nomenclature are not up to the mark.But it is a lot better than morrison and boyed and other books.You must go for this one."
"This book has intuitive back questions which is nt found in the original so that s a great bonus.. book is just awesome! 
the details in the book help a lot to get from basics till advance.
better than original"
"A very good book for clearing concepts.
For entrance examinations, it is of great use.
All reactions have been explained very well by explaining their reaction mechanisms.
A good no. of problems.
Its an excellent book for conversions of one compound to another.
A very good for making your base strong.
However, there are some errors in the book but they are very less."
"This is a very good for the purpose of IIT JEE. But one needs to have a good knowledge of the NCERT text before jumping on to this book. Except the electron potential diagrams everything suites me. It unravels many facts that r not present in the NCERT. A must book for IIT JEE. My suggestion : Please read the preface and note to students before reading the text."
"this book is a great book the one who has preferred das gupta s book might find some similarity in this book but yes it is based upon the latest iit jee pattern also it focuses on the latest exam ISEET which can be a reason to call it one of the greatest book in algebra. Permutations and combination, matrices and det are the best part in it."
"this book is not so good . its just a bit fancy but the content is not so good . its not worth buying , for algebra you can go for arihant S K GOYAL FOR IIT OR HALL AND KNIGHT."
"The book builds its theory and sets the pace nicely. The problems are structured in order to facilitate a student to learn the content from scratch. Unlike TMH s classic (which is good to solve when you have learn t everything), this book and all other books in this series build gradually, to bring the student to IIT standard. If you are a serious aspirant and require a perspective over some concepts, this is a neat presentation to follow. Altogether, its worth its cost. Thanks to the authors for the nice work."
"
 First of all thank you FLIPKART for your excellent delivery . And also thank full for WS Retail . 
 This book have all concepts and tricky questions which you need . Really It also have good tricky questions...........
 IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE CONCEPTS ......then you should buy it ......... "
"this is a perfect book for all the iit jee aspirants. all the topics esp. functions and limits are appropriately covered. flipkart makes this book easily available to all of us. this is the best and the best of best new books for the new pattern. :)"
"I ordered this book for preparation of a competitive exam just to brush up my concepts and refer to i had a doubt or something.... this book fails on both accounts neither has good concepts or solved examples. on top of it they have used theorems and notations of B.Sc mathematics level. Solved examples are just collected randomly from here and there... Waste of money and time( which obviously authors did not devote while writing)"
"
 DON NOT LOOK BEYOND THESE MATH BOOKS FOR IIT MATH.GO FOR IT MUST BUY.
this edition of the book has GREAT COLORS and reading experience is just worth it and truly rewarding.fun to read.THIS BOOK DOES WHAT IT PROMISES,goes from the BASICS AND BUILDS UP,TOPICS LIKE GRAPHICAL TRANSFORMATIONS WHICH IS IN ARIHANT ALSO.WILEY AND ARIHANT MATH BOOKS ARE THE PERFECT COMBINATION TO ACE MATHEMATICS.CENGAGE MATH BOOKS ARE NOT THAT GOOD. "
"Well this is an good book but not that as we need for JEE Advanced. If yo re not that interested in calculus then this is the GOD book for you. But if you want to learn deeply then you must leave this book.In short theory is not good.
By the way questions are too good for practice it contains a great amount of solved example for better understanding. If you just want to learn calculus for JEE then you should go for it."
"
 Excellent book for problem solving and provides an extremely wide variety.However advise you to know the concepts thoroughly before trying the problems and glancing at the various solved examples.
Loved it. "
"This great book contain all about calculus that is required for an undergraduate. Very deep theory, in between questions to memorize the concepts, exercise for practice (which contain IIT JEE questions). 
In my opinion, no one after buying this book would say that it was a waste ."
"This is a really good book in my opinion, simply because of the way concepts are explained. It s simple, concise, and if you read it properly, you feel someone is actually explaining stuff to you real-time.
It is finally a Resnick Halliday :) and adapted for IIT JEE! Provides for the a pretty much perfect read :)"
"I just love this book,because it has a good explanation with real figures and pictures.Its colourful pages makes it more attractive.In every physics lover should have it.Its my personal experience that I got each concept full understood.thanks to respective writets."
"It s got all necessary points and many derivations and many many questions MCQs as well as others. It is a must have for students preparing for IIT-JEE. It s got lots of sample questions more as well. It is worth to read from cover to cover"
"this book is undoubtedly the worst book for iit jee so far.its so elementary i gues the cover page should have been like this physics for class -4 . so because of this mistake i urge you to not buy this book. 
to solve this book you really need iq. 
iq of- 60"
"First of all, the main difference from the original text is that a separate exercise for objective problems and an additional subjective problems exercise has been added. But being acquainted with Amit Gupta through bansal classes i expected problems of more higher difficulty. Some of the problems in the additional exercise are directly from H C verma ,so the other ones must be from other international authors. 
Pros:
1) Theory is sufficient for JEE 
2) Printing is of very good quality 
3) Answers are given to both odd and even numbered problems unlike the original text. 
4) Problems are solved through the four C s approach which is a good approach for the new analytical type of JEE problems. 
Cons:
1)Would have appreciated a few dozen more problems.
 No other Cons."
"The original Resnick Halliday is a masterpiece in physics education. It is used as a brand name to boost up the sale of this book. It is claimed that the original Resnick Halliday book is adapted for IITJEE. In reality, it is a low grade book by author of a Kota based coaching class with a few diagrams and bits and pieces copied from the original book. 
The original Resnick Halliday is matured over several years and has no conceptual error, no typographical error. This book has plenty of typographical error and a few conceptual errors. So, it is not recommended for students. Only teachers capable of locating the errors should use it. I suggest the authors to be fair to the readers by publishing an errata on the net. 
You can get solutions of all questions and exercises in original Resnick Halliday. They are available in Instructors resource whose copy is available on internet. This adapted version has only questions and answers. But no solutions. Quality of questions and exercises in original book is much better than the adapted one. 
Original Resnick Halliday has index for reference. The adapted one does not have. 
The most serious blunder is about the approach of book. The original book targets teaching concepts and concepts used as tools for solving problems. The adapted book rather targets making the reader familiar with patterns on problems appearing in competitive exams. the reader will learn the pattern based methods of problem solving. Concepts may be learnt as a secondary outcome. This is typical approach of many a successful teachers in the commercial field of JEE coaching. There are many guide books written by them. This is just one more book of the same class. But publisher and author has smartly borrowed (for some fee?) the brandname of famous Resnick Halliday to attract customers. 
They intended to combine goodness of Resnick Halliday with focus on JEE. What has come out from the experiment is a caricature of Resnick Halliday . If the publisher wants to be honest, the book should be published without any reference to Resnick Halliday ."
"This book is argubly the best book in the market if u r looking to crack iit jee just bcoz of the fact that this is the compilation of the best theory out there in physics which explains all the concepts to u in the simplest way possible with the best qns out there given in latest jee main and advanced format. but the only problem i found with this book is the fact that none of the mcqs or exercise problems have solutions and sadly there is no other solution book out there which you could buy.. i have searched all over the internet and in the book stalls but none of them have the solution manual .. so if any of u guys have any idea where i could find the solution manual i would easily give it 5 stars but for now just 3 stars"
"This book is good. It contains pictures of everything and checkpoints problems. It contains detailed theory . The paper of this book is very smooth and good."
"this book helped me alot..i m just in class 9th but bcoz of this book i m able 2 understand the higher level of PHYSICS..everyone canot prefer this book as it need dedication and interest 2 solve this book.."
"Everything given in the book is easy to understand, provided one has a little of patience. There are plenty of high quality solved and unsolved questions, that are ideal for building conceptual understanding.
However, this book contains it s share of errors, and if you haven t recieved a separate errata leaflet with the book, please ask for it immediately."
"A genuine book that starts from zero level itself and strengthens the basics of organic chemistry.. Excellent interpretation of reaction mechanisms.. A must-buy for IIT aspirants.. Perfect language.. Proper steps given for each topic.. What more can we expect??"
"I Had No Book For IIT JEE Organic Chemistry...and Many Of My Friends Had Morrison And Boyd. But This Book is Nicely Crafted For The IIT JEE Pattern.Everything is explained very nicely. The Only -ve Point That I Have Found Till Now, was in The Hyperconjugation topic which said that isobutene is the most stable isomer of butene (i.e. more than trans but-2-ene), which is wrong.(You may check the data in morrison and boyd in heat of hydrogenation table).Otherwise The Book Provides Everything You Need...A very Good Collection Of Questions To Master Your Skiils....One Of The Most Perfect Book Ever !!"
"This book is an amazing book for Organic Chemistry. I would say that every single mechanism and possible explanation has been given for everything that an IIT aspirant would encounter before the JEE. 
The theory has been supplemented by excellent solved problems as well as additional problems and MCQs of JEE level. The questions make you think and you will find Organic Chemistry much easier with the help of this book. 
This book has exactly what you need for grades 11 and 12, unlike Morrison and Boyd, that has extra topics as well. The questions in that are also not as good as this. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone wanting to master Organic Chemistry."
"I was already in love with Solomon and Fryhle s Organic Chemistry, and then I saw this book, reading it was lovely. It is in a concise, to the point and unnecessary details have been omitted. It has also become much well presented then the original book. And the biggest addition would be the additional exercises. If you have done organic chemistry from this book, be assured that your IIT JEE paper, organic chemistry would be smooth."
"best book of organic chemistry ever seen
solomon s organic chemistry was itself a good book but had some extra points not required as per iitjee syllabus but Mr. M.S. Chouhan has completely solved that problem. best for mechanistic approach in organic chemistry"
"Really nice handling by flipkart.
I bought the original graham solomones,which was itself great.but this book has shaped it to cater for iitjee and others exams needs.some examples oriented for the exams have been added in every topic,and solved & unsolved JEE type questions have been in added in a good number,apart from the problems that originally existed.Theory is very nice,especially for chemistry haters,credits to graham ans solomons.MS Chouhan has done an awesome job in editing.highly Recommended for all 11th-12th class students."
"Hello friends it is a best book for organic chemistry everything clearly understable and from basic it has been designed so i suggest to buy this book strictly for iit jee."
"A good book to make concept clear.All the things are given in detail especially nomenclature which is according to new concept of IUPAC.It is also trusted by askiitians.com.In my choice you should buy this book."
"book explains concepts very nicely. Though all topics aren t organised in a great way you have to really look into index of this book to look for required content. Recommended for those who are really into organic chemistry. As far as JEE is concerned book has very good questions with solutions. so thumbs up for this one."
"First Solomons himself : Outstanding work . Second : adaptation by MSC : The book is good in explanations where solomons has been written as in original work . Then MSC adds his own stuff from JEE point of view . The added stuff is good content coverage wise but explanation wise its really weak . He has not taken any pains to explain his added stuff on the same level as solomons. This makes the book lopsided . Also some of the concepts added are not needed for JEE but thats alright ; its always good to know a little extra. Final word : Good book for coverage as compared to other similar stuff available in the market . But not self sufficient for self study . Buy it to supplement your studies if you are in a coaching ."
"FIRST OF ALL THANKS FLIPKART FOR ITS AMAZIN SERVICES!
THIS BOOK IS NICE ATTRACTIVE AND DIGS UP RIGHT TO BUILD YOUR BASE AND CONCEPTS FOR IITJEE. ONLY ONE THING BAD ABOUT THIS IS THAT THE TEXT IS TOO LENGHTY AND U HAVE TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME TO READ IT! SOMETIMES IT BORES U.THE PRACTICE BOK QUESTIONS ARE OF A GOOD LEVEL, BUT MANY QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM P RADEEP
BUT IF ONE READS IT PROPERLY BY HEART U WILL FEEL CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO FACE QUESTIONS."
"
 nice theory ..... nice questions for exercise ....
over all a worth for money book ....
this is great book with extra detailed theory and some extra conceptual questions .....
colors adds an extra 5 stars to this book making reading this book fun ... "
"
 Excellent service by Flipkart
THE BEST and must read book for class12 Physics,with colour pics ,lots of worked examples,MCQs
and old Question papers in a CD "
"FRIENDS, I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND ANY ONE TO BUY THIS BOOK. IF ANY ONE WISHES TO BUY A PHYSICS BOOK, GO FOR ORIGINAL RESNICK HALLIDAY. THAT BOOK IS MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN THIS AND IS EVEN CHEAPER."
"The theory of the book is great but it doesn t have many important derivations such as centre of mass of sphere,disc,cone,triangle etc.,also it doesn t have inclined projection.I recommend it especially for cbse level.Anyway if u r buying it for cbse,go for it......"
"I use this book to teach my Daughter - Book has good description and is full of excellent examples. Also it takes an algebra based approach which I think makes it ideal for people who don t have background in calculus.
Lot of practical applications are given as well - Book is verbose and it really needs time to read. If you are short of time, use H.C.Verma but if you want to enjoy physics and that too a strong conceptual overview, this book should be on the top of your list. At times I see some definitions to be not very precise but if you read carefully and solve the problems, you will definitely become strong in physics - Instructors who teach may find the book rewarding. Supplementing this book has lot of solutions for NCERT and their objective questions look good though the there are no detailed solutions. 
While the book is expensive, I think it is worth the price and solving all problems can make a person to take state level entrance and AIPMT. For IIT, you are better off with HC Verma with great collection of problems."
"
 a good culture is required for good habits,similarly good BOOk is also be best... 
this is oF a tyPe beSt!!! 
YoU should buy this, "
"Excellent..... Superb......Perfect for JEE....A practicible combo of numericals and theory..very useful...and variety of numericals of diffrnt levels..."
"Jus go for it if you love physicS!!!!!this book is the one thing you will need to fulfil your needs to improve physics....it has been written by some the best physicists in the world....it explains to you all the concepts very properly....and because its printed in colour it gives you a good feeling while studying physicS!!!!"
"
 i used this book throughout my year in 11th and barely needed to touch ncert physics as it covers 99% of the syllabus. the key points,more to know sections make it more interesting.
though its a very basic book.. but will surely help u to get those basics right. "

"Please do not buy this book. It is completely waste of money. Especially, from WE Retail they will send you only practice book and not textbook as described in the website. This book comes in set of two book i.e.- textbook and practice book and a CD. 
I ordered this book and found that they have sent me wrong book(Practice). I requested for replacement. But the replacement book was also wrong one. It seems that they don t won t to sell the original book as described. If yo ll buy this book yo ll regret. 
This book is made by combining some other books. Instead of buying this book you can buy 
1) JD Lee- Inorganic chemistry
2) Organic Chemistry by T. W. Graham Solomons and
3) Atkin s Physical Chemistry Or you can also buy OP Tondon"
"I really appreciate the way, basics are explained with lots of solved example in this book. Though costly, I was a bit apprehensive about its content, but after going through pages, I found it worth buying. As a parent, I feel this book has really made chemistry as easy as ABC, with facts explained in simple language. I recommend it for all serious students preparing for competitive exams as well as for those desirous of a conceptual knowledge in Chemistry for the course work."
"
 In page No. 118 of the Practice Book electronic configuration of the elements Potassium(K) and Rubidium(Rn) are wrongly printed. In page No 362 of the same book in chapter equilibrium challenge problem HOTS question 5 the answer is given wrong it should be 0.66 gram instead of 8.3094 grm 
please look into this matter otherwise it create confusion to the students. "
"Pros: 1 good matter for organic and inorganic 
 2. Work Book Is helpful 
Cons: 1.Very Bad content for physical/general chemistry 
 2.Although the book says : A Must-Have Resource Book JEE Topics related to competition are not explained .And in some chapters it does not focuses on competition. 
 3.Bad theory (infact NCERT is better than it) 
My Opinion : it has really bad theory 
cd is of no use.
Don t go for it , try pradeep s"
"i bought this book in around april this year,and red most of it,it s one of the most wonderful book one can ever read,the coloured illustration is awesome,the book is divided into 2 parts,1st part has theory and some questions(around 50 per chapter),2nd part is full of questions for both board exams and competitions.
Theory has been explained very well,the cd is also good.If comparing to pradeep it could be a little thin , but concepts has been brilliantly explained in this book,i would recommend this book to all the one s who are willing to have one chemistry book."
"This is one book which I would recommend to anyone who are looking to have a good understanding of the subject. It is more or like the NCERT class 11 chemistry book, But it has a lot of inclusions from JD.LEE s and SOLOMON and FRYHLE s book. The additional CD is very helpful and the Practice book is more like RANJI SAHI s book. YES, This is a must have resource for any IIT Aspirant."
"colourful, completely cbse based, satisfactory explaination, easy n to the point, differentiable errors"
"really a must have resource book for boards and competitions.......must have dis............................................."
"this book is not helpful for class 11 cbse student . so don t waste your valuable money on it instead go for guide like pradeep."
"the other reference books contain more of bulk than quality.. this book though lacked theory in the begging chpters which are of physical chem but from chapter 5 onwards...it was worth it all. enjoyed learning from it. keep this book and your ncert open together while studying."
"A GOOD BOOK BUT BE AWARE THAT INSTEAD OF 
ORIGINAL KNOWLEDGE BANK DVD AS ADVERTISED 
ON THE FRONT COVER OF THE BOOK, I GOT A CD COPY ONLY. 
THE BOOK SHOULD BE READ WITH THE ORIGINAL
 CONCISE INORGANIC CHEMISTRY BY J.D. LEE AND
 ORGANIC CHEMISTRY BY SOLOMONS & FRYLE 
ALONGWITH THE PRACTICE BOOK."
"Excellent book, with a dual approach towards the boards and joint entrances. Useful, accurate, exhaustive!"
"
 First of all thank you FLIPKART for your excellent delivery . I ordered this on 23 November and got in 24 November 2014 with free delivery . And also thank full for WS Retail . 
 This book have all concepts and tricky questions which you need . You can know what is geometry and how to use it . Really It also have good tricky questions...........
 IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE CONCEPTS OF GEOMETRY.......then you should buy it ......... "
"
 Anyone who needs to learn and understand the concepts of Geometry are highly recommended to buy this great book. It can help in scoring high marks in JEE main and advanced as it suggests. 
Theory is explained in deep. It contains in between questions to make the concepts thorough. There are many questions given in the exercises to test our logic & ability to solve problems. 
All together buying this book will only lead us to greater heights in future. "
"
 Very Good one and outstanding Indian edition of Resnick and Halliday by Amit Gupta having lot of unsolved objective type questions at the end of each chapter which area really challenging and upto the level of IIT JEE, Overall theory is also very Good.
So any one trying for IIT must buy this. "
"AMAZING AND GREAT EFFORT BY A.GUPTA AND THANKS TO WILEY INDIA FOR THE INDIAN VERSION OF THE BOOK. A PERFECT IIT APPROACH..ALTHOUGH IT HAS MOSTLY ORIGINAL VERSION THEORY AND PROBLEMS BUT THE APPROACH OF PRESENTING THIS INDIAN EDITION IS DIFFERENT..A BEAUTIFUL BOOK"
"
 bc pandey much better
buy all the five books of the set with the new pattern iitjee question bank
if you want to have some really tough stuff then go for i.e.irodov
only after completing h.c.verma
but try to get the answers of all the questions yourself without any aid "

"the book does not contain explanations for its questions and is therefore not recommended for anyone thinking to buy a book that contains questions with explanations"
"it is good for learning basics ,explanation with numerical examples is in fact good so a must have for those preparing for JEE Advance"
"
 Book Is very good and fully based on concepts Question . Quality of question given in the exercises are very good . But If you are doing this book you feel that You want more question for practice . 
Advice - By those books which have specific and less chapter . Based on limited topic ( But covers all the aspects of that limited topics ).include theory and numerical . "
"This book is very good. The concepts are completely picked from Haliday,Resnick,Walker extended edition and copied in this book which makes it a very good book or simply the best book for concepts but still it lacks solutions to exercises which should have been provided.
I will suggest others not to buy this book but buy Haliday,Resnick Walker 9th edition fundamentals of physics and H.C.Verma for numericals.
If you want all 3 things-solutions,concepts and numericals then go for CENGAGE publishers.
But still this book is great for theory and questions. Only problem it doesn t contain solutions so think once before you buy."
"
 it has hcv questions included in it in its back exercises,
it is definitely better than hc verma,
it has ample of questions to practice that are better than hcv. "
"
 great subject matter !
great sample problems !
pretty easy to grasp & in fact a better substitution to few teachers
a must buy for any 10 1 science student 
and not to mention the excellent service offered by ws retail ! "
"Physical-I ll manage. Inorganic-Easy Organic-uff!! so tough
Well if you have the same kind of approach for organic...go for this one.
Pros:1) Incredible Content
 2)All reactions properly explained
 3)Easy for organic fearing
 4)Wiley plus support
Cons:1)Questions bank is not good
 2)Not adapted for objective examinations"
"i am 10th class student it is amazing book very easy to understand ......if we you want to prepare for competitive exams you must buy it"
"Book is good , but some color would have been much better . Content is really helpful. Hope it will be a great asset to me."
"Graham Solomon and Fryhle have put a lot of efforts to prove that their book is the best in the market currently. 
For all those who are IIT-JEE Aspirants, this book is a must buy to understand every concept easily. It contains a lot of information which is more than sufficient who wants to get a good rank JEE-Main or Advanced.
Although I would recommend other books for solving problems of Organic Chemistry. I would recommend Himanshu Pandey s Organic Chemistry book."
"This book contain good theory but not prescribe it for iit as it only contain specific topics and not according to iit syllabus. I would recommend for optical isomerism only."
"Excellent product. Best for subjective problems but solution manual required for checking the answers. However, GOC is not covered in solomons for GOC prefer paula bruice."
"I have purchased it for my sister & she is happy with it. She said it is the best book for the said subject."
"solomons and fryhle is the most basic and best book and a must buy. it consists of a good theory and iit aspirants are recommended to solve problems from books from indian authors like homanshu pandey etc."
"
 The Product was Delivered next day itself, and as far as the book is concerned, its a piece of art!
everything has been explained well and is easily understandable.. "
"
 this book has the topics for organic chemistry from the scratch..and kindly go for this book..this book can be used for both undergraduates and post graduates as well.. 
AND FLIPKART DELIVERY SYSTEM IS THE BEST..!!! "
"Pros - 
Firstly, this book is awsome ! It has deepest theory and every detail of it is presented in a great manner. Furthurmore, it has many solved examples after every single topic which makes it easier to understand.
How many of you had trouble learning IONIC EQUILIBRIUM or REDOX REACTION ?? I did. I searched many books to find good text on these topics.... And i did found them.... But this book is above them all. Previous years questions of examinations have also been added .
Cons -
There are few cons.... The major one being poor quality of answers to the questions. DONT refer this book for questions (until you have too much time) . RC MUKHERJEE was and still is the best book for attempting problems and practicing them.
Final Word-
1. Read theory from this book.
2. Solve RC Mukherjee.
3. Solve questions of your coaching classes.
4. Solve previous years exams questions.
You will crack any competitive exam ! :)"
"
 Merits :This book is rich in concepts and problems essential to crack IIT JEE. New and different types of problems are introduced and strategies to crack there are explained very well. This book is a rich storehouse of various sorts of problems like Assertion Reason, Integer answer type, Linked comprehension etc.
Demerits : A pile of calculation errors and the answers to some questions in exercises (MCQ) are provided with wrong answers. Some topics like azeotropes ,emf values are all mismatched. 
Conclusion : A great book to get clear concepts but make sure that the errors are notified n rectified. Work out the different strokes of problems . :) "
"There are a lot of misprints in the book which confuses the student but otherwise the theory is good enough."
"
 This book is a boon for IIT & Medical aspirants! 
Many of us face difficulties in solving problems in Physical Chemistry but this book is a one stop solution. 
Despite the good conceptual content there are some typos and miscalculations which can be noticed easily and rectified. So far it is the best book to clear your concepts about the subject in detail. 
After reading this book you can definitely solve 90% of the questions in Physical Chem. "
"Its really a good book for gaining pure concepts on Physical Chemistry. It contains great questions. :)"
"very good compilation and collection of problems... well structured, covers almost everything with right depth but too many typing and calculation mistakes in solved numerical problems."
"its totally rubbish and time consuming"
"This is a really nicely organised and compact book for engineering and medical entrance examinations....Also its a very helpful reference text for postgraduate students like me..."
"A good book covering the theory in details. Perhaps the best Physical Chemistry book for iitjee. It contains lot of solved out problems asked in iitjee and aieee. Exercises at the end of chapters are also very useful. It contains some important topics which are not included in other iitjee books. The only drawback is lack of new of problems."
"
 this book is very good for iit aspirants it is the only chemistry book that starts from basics and leads us to the world of chemistry topics covered in an interesting way
a book that must be in the hand of all iit aspirants.... "
"
 Pros 
1) Chemical Bonding, Periodic Properties, Most of inorganic 
2) Extremely relevant for IIT JEE (To the syllabus) 
Only one drawback.... 
Con: Coordination CHemistry not well explained. 
If u want to learn inorganic chemistry.. Look no where else. "
"Till now i ve gone through several books for inorganic... and the syllabus of inorganic has been always confusing, the theory given in the book is straight and builds very strong concept.... the language is made as simple as possible.... It also contains exercises which have plenty of concept building problems..... There s no book like this one.... I would recommend to click on the buy option...and feel its essence..."
"I bought this book for my preparation for iit jee.This book has a lot of subject and very less no of questiions. It will be a good choice if you have lots of time for preparation.I will not recommend this book if you want to revise the subject , want to solve problems or if you have less time."
"1st of all i would like to thank flipkart team for there extraordinary delivery timings..superb 
About the book,well its a must one for iit-jee aspirants to make concepts deeper upto the level relevant to iit-jee in chemistry.There has been emphasis on each and every concept which is truly appropriate for iit-jee as far as inorganic chemistry is conerned followed by
some brain storming exercises to increase one s analytical ability upto the level of jee.
VERY USEFUL INDEED"
"just covered one chapter - chemical bonding and on this sample basic I reckon say some stuffs are really detailed good but some are missing completely like resonance and explaining shape of ethene so you would other books too.. mind Hybridization is bit abstract at first reading"
"i am very weak in chemistry , i bought this book hoping that it will help me , but it was not my cup of tea. read through a few pages and thereafter never opened it."
"The best part of this book is its easy language and well arranged contents !! Excellent book for JEE aspirants !!"
"This book is the best available book for inorganic chemistry..... contains appropriate study material along with practice questions... This is a mustbuy book and worth the money"
"The best inorganic chemistry book for iitjee. Medical aspirants can also buy this book. Though the best part of this series is Organic Chemistry by Solomons and Fryhle. For best result one should buy this edition along with the original edition. Contains lot of interesting topics that are not included in other inorganic chemistry books. For all iit aspirants I would suggest them to buy all the three books of maestro series.(i.e- J D Lee, Solomons and Fryhle and the physical chemistry book by some unknown author."
"Received the book just the other day
J.D Lee s books are well know and this book similar and a best book for jee aspirants.
conceptually the book is awesome.you find proper assessment pattern for jee,being concise it deals with only the subject which is important. 
I would recommend an jee aspirant to go for this book....."
"The book is great to study organic chemistry but requires you to have atleast some basic knowledge of the subject..
Pros..
1. Includes all required reaction mechanisms to understand better -an edge over books books like Arihant Organic Chemistry by RK Gupta 
2. Stereochemistry(and explanation with structures) is just mind blowing.
3.A lot of irrelevant parts(wrt IIT JEE) has been removed.
4. Exercises and intext questions are far better than Indian writers
5. Good explanations.
Cons..
1. As the book is an adaptive version of the original Original Chemistry By Solomons & Fryhle a lot of good illustrations have also been removed in order to make it compact.
2. Two chapters that have been added at the end of the book are not so good.
3. It requires a pre-knowledge of the subject else you will be stuck many a times.
Overall, the book has some problems but is good enough to prepare you well for competitive exams."
"If you are comparing this book to the MORRISON AND BOYD then this one is sure better. The print quality will make you fall in love with organic chemistry. The questions provided are average. But the theory part is AWSMM !!!! The only book i personally feel can outmatch this book is BROWNE AND FOOTE . But that book is not set for IIT-JEE. It has some additional concepts as well. But yeah.... That is the best. But this one is definitely better than all other organic chemistry books (for theory) !"
"Simply the best book for organic chemistry for iit jee. Contains various types of good questions. This adapted version is better than the original one as it contains all the relevant concepts required for jee."
"this book has been a boon to me. it covers almost every topic in a very elaborated way. i would recommend it to every organic lover and of course to those giving jee. 
the main problem is that it does not cover much problems. for that you may have to purchase some other book, in case you don t have q. banks or study materials. it also does not cover jee problems (prev yrs) and every chap has about 10-15 mcqs only and subjective questions are not quite worth doing. 
and the chapters are not given in ncert style and you may have to look for index for different topics. some topic which must be explained earlier are explained later on like aromatic compounds. 
but still, if you have the courage, and you want to understand the organic to the best of its level, this must be your choice!"
"This book is to the point. Chapters are followed by numericals. Really nice . Take a chance and buy it . But read it completely"
"
 I bought this book for my jee mains & advance practice and it has helped me in resolving all my problems in organic chemistry.
It has an easy to understand language and is given with fine examples & exceptions. Apart from this it also has excercises based on topics that help you to test and analyse yourself.
All in all it is a must buy for all those who wish to score good in organic chemistry espacially in advance. 
best of luck for your exams guys (Y) :) "
"This book is for concepts of Organic Chemistry, uptill now it has been a problem with foreign writer s books that questions are not included or if included they are insufficient for Entrance Exams in India but this book comes with a solution, since it is adapted by M.S. Chauhan, it has ample amount of questions, also content of the book is relevant for JEE, not included those parts which are irrelevant for JEE. 
 Also pages of book and text of the book make you fall in love with Organic and you won t feel like those foreign writer s book which are actually Xerox type (made for subcontinent students only, also cheaper than the original one)."
"
 i bought this book from fipkart. the delivery was good.. and talking about the book, its awesome :D one ofthe best books for organic chemistry with each and every reaction.. the most important part being that it gives full mechanism of every reaction so eliminates the chance of any doubt indeed !! 
Just buy it :D "
"delivery was fast and packing was good 
latest at Rs500 that s a bargain
Pros:
1)the questions and theory are excellent and problems at the end are iit jee level
2)all topics covered perfectly
Cons:
1)Use carefully as binding might become undone"
"First Solomons himself : Outstanding work . 
Second : adaptation by MSC : The book is good in explanations where solomons has been written as in original work . Then MSC adds his own stuff from JEE point of view . The added stuff is good content coverage wise but explanation wise its really weak . He has not taken any pains to explain his added stuff on the same level as solomons. This makes the book lopsided . Also some of the concepts added are not needed for JEE but thats alright ; its always good to know a little extra. 
Final word : Good book for coverage as compared to other similar stuff available in the market . But not self sufficient for self study . Buy it to supplement your studies if you are in a coaching ."
"dis a great piece of art. ever book contains q and answer but this really have the motivating lines
really help ful"
"
 This book has a few key points at the start of each chapter and minimal but good questions which would suffice for avg marks.
Would not be the first choice for cet prep but rather a quick brushup. 
Second PU

Theory is little weak.. Ideal for Question Practicing.. Everything is solved. 
Must have to will to Learn nd Solving.. If you give your good time to this book.. u will definitely Succeed.. Meet you all in JEE 2013"
"
 This book is such a waste of time and money. If you are looking for a good or knowledge worthy book so please dnt waste ur time over it...... 
Drawbacks of the book:
*chapters are nt explained properly.
*lack of information about the given topics.
* lots and lots of spelling mistakes...
*Topics are not covered properly, done in a short way.. "
"
 easy and right for self practice and understand 
all section are in detail 
methods are right and less error in book "
"
 Not up to mark but get you Know about type of question actually asked in CMAT
Gernal Awareness waste....................///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// "
"
 Complete theory and collection of large no of problems
All the problems are solved in detail that gives an opportunity of self learning at home also.... nice attempt !!!!!
One thing I didnt like the size of the book... its not that convenient.. "
"the book provides excellent theory and bulids a strong base for solving each and every type of numericals . THe book contains every type of questions and provides a lot of questions to solve which builds the confidence AN EXCELLENT BOOK BUY CENGAGE .THANKS to FLIPKART FOR PROVIDING THIS BOOK ... THANKS A LOT ......... PLEASE GO FOR THIS BOOK IF YOU WANT TO SCORE GOOD MARKS IN PHYSICS IIT - JEE..!!"
"good theory and builds confidence every cengage rocks. also you will understand it very easily and can solve problems on it. solutions are also given to make it more clear. i was afraid of physics but not now. also you can tray hc verma and resnick,halliday and krane for physics"
"The book is good for entrance examinations, error level in the book is low. The 3D Geometry part of this book is written with vectors and also without vectors. So this will be good for everyone. Overall performance is good."
"
 BOOK IS NOT SO GOOD. BASIC VECTOR TOPIC IS NOT GIVEN . IT IS ACTUALLY A WAIST. U CAN OPT FOR ARIHANT BOOK OF THE SAME. 
PLEASE DONT BUY THIS BOOK. THEORY PART IS NOT GIVEN WELL I AM A CERTIFIED BUYER AND IS NOT WELL DEVELOPED "
"This book is really AWESOMEEEEE..!!!
the theory is really good...and the problems after that are such, that you will understand what the theory part taught you, properly.
i agree very much with kshitij (above)..
you have everything u need, to know in calculus..starting from basic level to advanced...all in this book...
i like calculus..and this book has made me love it..!!..
SIMPLY AMAZING..EASY TO UNDERSTAND TOO..!!!
thank you flipkart for the wonderful packing..got it on d mentioned date...great service...!!
guys and gals..this is THE book for calculus...!!!!...:D"
"It is the best book for orgnic chemistry covering all the topics for organic. 
The best thing is that every reaction is explained with its mechanism.i.e. from where the bond is breaking,from where the nucleophilic reagant is attacking etc. 
If you prepare from this book surely there will be no question in organic that you can t solve.
IT S THE BEST BOOK FOR PREPARATION OF ENTRANCES EXAMS. 
ALSO THE PHYSICAL CHMESITRY BY CENGAGE IS THE BEST FOR EXAMS 
A very good book to get a firm understanding for organic chemistry....for iit and for cbse. Except for a few mistakes here and there....a very great book to buy!!!!!!
I bought this book a few days ago and I am seriously glad that I bought it. The book features a very good collection of solved problems and exercises. Moreover the author has taken the pain to highlight important conceptual questions in the exercise to facilitate for easy revision during the last phases of exam preparation. Also, the theory is very well given and easy to grasp and understand. The solutions to the exercises which are given at the end of each chapter are very descriptive and help to any doubts which arise while solving the questions. I am yet to see any thing in this book which I do not like. It is a very good book to build your basic concepts (like GOC, Nomenclature and Isomerism) which are going to be indispensable while solving the chapters ahead (like hydrocarbons, alkyl halides,alcohols,ketones,etc.)
I would recommend this book to every JEE aspirant. 
 superanna superu"
"I think this is the best book which cope with the demands of jee candidates. The chapters are given in an organized way in which a jee aspirants should study. Excellent dealing of theory with lot of questions to practice. Plz don\ t think much and have it if you want to become master in organic. I have also gone through Solomons and Morrison&Boyd but those books didn\ t dealt with chapters in JEE manner . Therefore I strongly recommend this book for all jee aspirants."
"if u want drill into the subject this is the only one book .No book in the market can compete with this book even the word awesome is too small it is the best and it will be the best and the only book strictly for JEE ADVANCED."
"nice theory plenty of questions user friendly 
i have completed my week portions frm this book
no need of tuition for organic
tables made are simplely excellent
must buy to crack jee and other exams
achievers portion given in this book is supper"
"
 one of the best book of physical chemistry with excellent theory and plenty of questions which are really challenging....
i would prefer you to buy this book.......
SIMPLY LOVED SOLVING THE CHALLENGING PROBLEMS THE THEORY HAS BEEN WELL EXPLAINED WITH GR8 ILLUSTRATIONS TRULY WORTHY IIT JEE BOOK....... "
"this book contains questions of jee level...but is recommended to be bought only when pradeeps uss and arihants are done solving.......bcoz those books form the base .....this book is good for revision...."
"Once you finish your course.. and have 2-3 months left then you can definitely go with this book.. every chapter has about 50 questions covering nearly all concepts. After solving this book you will surely gain a lot of confidence. The best thing is this you can solve this book in remaining time.. this book is has very less errors. Go with it..it is the best available choice! All the best with your preparation! :)"
"This is an awesome book for those who want excel with concepts in physical chemistry . The topics are covered in an excellent way . A number of questions are given for practice . Being a student of a famous coaching center for iit I would like to tell you that most questions and theory of their package is directly copied from chapters of this book . The book is awesome , just go for it ."
"When you will look the size of this book, you will understand and still it has 2 parts. This book has theory very well explained with many solved examples and questions to solve. You will not feel it is not enough for IIT. It is better than O.P.Tandon also. So just buy it.........."
"KS Verma has just understood the requirements of student community for JEE Advanced.But this book is also very useful for JEE Mains.By buying these books the need for additional books is reduced as these books are covering a very wide requirements and techniques"
"
 Nice book........... you will need this....
bt i can myself find so many important things not being given much important.......... "
"complete course coverage (at times even felt a bit lenghty) . wholesome practice , JEE archive( solved) as well as solution to all problems makes it a one-stop-shop for phys. chemistry"

"The book very much like the subject has some exceptional qualities as well as disadvantages. Do not expect to learn organic chem from this book, rather expect to revise and improve your skills in org. chem using this. Compliment this book with a rather standard and recognized text on organic chem by some foreign authors and study that before using this to get max results. 
+ve points:
-Comprehensive. All-round Package. Explains whats necessary and mentions the obvious.
-Huge questions library. Good quality and context-full questions.
-Excellent for JEE - prep if used well. 
-ve points:
-Chapter on IUPAC Nomenclature is not well-written. May be tiring for some one learning from level-1 to start off using the book.
-Some topics require prerequisite knowledge of some basics. Referring NCERT for this purpose is advisable. 
No other crucial points to be noted.
Go ahead and buy the book. Combine with NCERT for best results."
"A very good book to get a firm understanding for organic chemistry....for iit and for cbse. Except for a few mistakes here and there....a very great book to buy!!!!!!"
"Its a good book for a iit aspirants but don t buy if you are beginners because it will send you in a state of dilemma as its most question will be not solved by you so please before buying you be sure that you have all the basic concepts clear then only you can solve this book. that s all good luck for your future with this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"KS Verma has written really very good books on Physical Chemistry and Organic Chemistry.They just complete the requirement of a students need"

"the books which were u selling is highly priced than outside shopkeepers so what is the difference btween them and u."
"Nice book... If u wish to get into the iit just excel in it....... Also practice all 5 books in each subjects... 
All the best!!!!"
"Fisrt try above mentioned book, then Cengage is the best book for cracking IIT. Cengage is mostly about Problem Solving Techniques. If you have done the basics right, master this book and look forward for IIT"
"This book is very good for building up concepts and is very helpful in preparing for jee advanced. It has hundreds of concept building solved examples and hundreds of questions for practice..."
"if you want to get a good rank in itt jee advanced this is one of the best books all my lectures also said that cengage books are best for advanced and for mass practice you may go for arihant but if you are damn sure about getting a seat in iit s you can go for cengage learning."
"
 Considering the mprice of total set . Its not worth single students. 
For teachers this is great.
I bought the set for my SIR.
He is spending nights finding the right parts needed at right moment in our IIT preparation.
Also it costs less for mass students and it amkes easy as teacher helps us with it.
The huge amount is hard to cover for students .Considering they do have various books and coaching home works "
"Awesome Book Related To Physics Physics And Physics......Goes Far Beyond The Textbooks And Makes You Explore Physics In A New Perspective"
"The title says it all. At this price, this book is worth every penny! The content is good, the sums are good, the methods are good too! Everything they teach you in coaching classes is given in depth in it! Though, one must have the basic intellectual power to grasp this topic. One can t blame the book!"

"It s A Good Buy For Preparing For JEE.....Has Ranging Question But I Recommend To First Develop A Strong Basic Concept Of Optics Before Approaching To Problems(That s How It Worked For Me But Can t Say About You)"
"please dont buy those arihant DC pandeys... BM sharma is a much better book in every perspective! from 0 to 100 it will help you through everything ! :)"
"
 BM Sharma Series is definitely the best book available for JEE Advanced Physics. If one can solve this book completely, his seat in JEE Advanced is guaranteed. 
5 satrs to the book. "
"pays more emphasis on subjective questions than objective pattern.....very bad illustration..........dc pandey s waves and thermodynamics is much better..the book is adequate for preparing 11 finals but not iit entrance"

 awesome
book is awsome it is helpful for students who want to crack iit jee exams..............student study themselves and do not require any tutor to teach this book "
"
 This book contains every question from level 0 to level 3
This is a must buy book if u are preparing for jee "
"
 Firstly this book is for those who know the tits and bits of calculus.This will be good for problem solving skills as each and every question is solved.
But if you are a beginner then it will be tough for you to grasp the theory.Thus for novices,Diff calculus integral calculus of Amit M Agarwal(Arihant) will be better.
Then only going through this book will be worthwhile.. "
"best book for algebra for those who r interested in self study.This book has helped me a lot in getting my basics right and has made maths as easy as possible.i recommend this book for all.buy this and you wont need a tutor or any coaching class assistance."
"A nice book for IIt Aspirants ,has alot of problems to go through which i assure are not at all easy ,this book covers almost all topics of algebra I reccomend IIt aspirants to have a go at the book"
"This is not a very easy book which everyone thinks if you only have your basics clear then only go for this book otherwise say bye bye to this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Level of Problems are decent enough to brain storm. Covers all varieties of Problems with a mixture of different concepts. Worth buying"
"
 This book is a book completely for every engineering exams. The book starts with simple polynomials which are taught in class 8th and goes to a very high level by explaining every single concept. Those who think S.K. Goyal Arihant Algebra is best, try this first you will not want to buy S.k.Goyal as it is a complete package. The concepts are explained very easily. Just go for it. It has lots of question. The best part of the book is that it has solutions of all questions.
Also Cengage books are always superb!!!!!!!!!!!!
You will see the difference when you use Cengage books. "
"
 This book is awesome for iit exam .it contains no of problems which helps us to practise .
mcq s are in twist and turn form which is really usefull to get the concept in depth .
concepts are explained clearly........ "
"
 the book is precise in terms of information and has less (around 20)subjective problems
but not in terms of illustrative solved examples and objective problems,
it has around 7 concept application exercises;

100 objective problems(single correct), 20 (multi correct),20 assertion & reasoning,
20 comprehension type, 20 integer type and 10 match type in each chapter. "
"book is awsome it is helpful for students who want to crack iit jee exams..............student study themselves and do not require any tutor to teach this book"
"
 Book covers lots of examples which helpful for practicing different types of problems of topics. The author covers the topic to the core with indepth subject knowledge and IIT- based examples and different formats of questions
Thanks to flipkart for quick delivery and great offer provided "
"I ve done some portions of circle from this book and I find this book really concise and well organized though same could not be said about other chapters - just based on quick survey of other chapters but this book may not suit to all beginner guys so better solved NCERT before taking this"
"The book is a boon for IIT aspirants, having many questions of good level it also provides good explanation of concepts as well."
"
 awesome

"Good book for IITJEE preparations. Not very tough, not trivial, but at the right level of 16/17 year old brain. There are about 16 books in this IITJEE-advanced preparations (Maths, physics, Chem). Good to have all of them at home and start preparing in synchronization with school teaching. All the best."
"it is best for slow learners and on who doesnt has any knowledge about this subject its like a text book, im having all the versions of this book. all are good if u want to score good marks in jee advanced this is one of the best books."
"A Big THUMBS UP to cengage for creating such amazing books. Every detail, every concept, every single sentence of every book is clearly put across. great theory, solved and unsolved exercises, excellent explanation, cengage rocks!!!"
"the book is pretty amazing and seriously helpful if u want to understand the chapter. Vectors And 3D is relatively easy and very scoring as per JEE is concerned.. so nice book overall :D"
"
 Superfast Delivery guys...good job...got the delivery on SUNDAY !!!!! 
This is a good pill for students trying to grab concepts along with problem practice..It gives u steady dosage of concepts and avoids indigestion... :)) "
"World Class Text Book..with quite a few printing mistakes...satisfactory explations and solutions to all the problems sums . Warning :- Please Buy it at least a year before you appear for Mains or Advanced because it will take time to get a grasp of the different type of sums and topics given."
"This is just a REVISION book, not full-length study material.
Formulas are given without derivations, imp. results arrived at just the same way. But the problems cover a wide variety of situations. The number of such problems is however oddly low. Some of the questions are from previous IIT question papers and Olympiads (a few).
Small and just about the right size for comprehensive revision.
But if you want more practice, better go for Arihant s A problem book in Chemistry or TMH s Comprehensive chemistry for JEE advanced ."
"flipkart always has this book out of stock ...... but i gave it 5 stars bcuz the book is amazing for all jee aspirants"
"Very Good Book. It s easy to understand. Everything is good. 
Packing is excellent.
Delivered before the promised date."
"
 This is a very good book for studying for IIT-JEE Examination.
I prefer to all to refer this book at least once if you are preparing for the IIT-JEE "
"its just the like bibble for JEE advanced if u follow it religiously u will get through the toughest phase of ur preparation happily and get a good rank in the exam!!!!!!!!!! it promotes analytical thinking"
"An extremely powerful book in strengthening concepts in physics. has many important modal problems. good for objective point of view."
"Folks, Even if you join the best college or the best coaching the teachers may not teach you better than this book. this book is owned by every student of sri chaitanya narayana academy which has maximum toppers in top 100, so i bought this book and found it very useful . concepts are given in detail and not even a small concept is left out. frankly speaking but after i joined sri chaitanya narayana academy i found it difficult to cope up with other students as they had already completed the syllabus of 11, 12. only with the help of this book i am able to understand the concepts (i mean the teachers dont teach well cos they think we already know 11, 12 state concepts) that s my personal experience...anyway there are more than 300 problems in each chapter which is more than enough for practice for iit."

"When G. Tewani and Cengage publication meets, what we get is this awesome calculus book. The main feature of the book is its precise theory with deep explanation of concepts & lots of question practice, includes graphical as well as basic approach, solutions are with deep explanation, concept application exercise keeps the track of solid learning. All NCERT questions are included, so you need not buy a RD Sharma for boards. However, Exercise questions may sometime seem too difficult or the solution mind-boggling, and such a large number of questions may prove to be useless as it takes too much time. So buy it if you target JEE Advance or if you want to learn mathematics at higher level. Keep practicing throughout the year and this book will become the best of your companion for the year....."
"this is an ultimate practice book for calculus
variety of ques..introductory exercise..nd with excellent theory
also contain archives,even not need to buy previous year iit sample papers
all previos iit questions are given with solute 
best for students appearing in entrance exams"
"This Publication is one of the best, But there are few mistakes. It is understandable that in first and second edition they may be there. But they might have been rectified before publishing."
"everybody should read this book to get a good rank in jee advance and for a better future in calculus field.........................................................................................best book that i had ever seen...."
"
 First of all hats of to flipkart....Got the product within one day
...As far as the book is concerned ...it is a must have for iit-jee aspirants.......Starting the base level it goes up to the high level..... "
"First of all hats off to flipkart delivery as i got the book the next day of placing the order and this a great book and also contains previous year iit jee problems as well as their solutions also"
"
 Best book ever...I am a IIT-JEE Mathematics tuitor, i would prefer this book...for you
Read It, refer it, Purchase it....you will never by any book "
"it is athe best most book for magnetism and electromagnetism i have read. the concepts are quite clearly expailned with examples."
"Cengage physics series is the best one can get for JEE preparation. Although it has some printing mistakes but that is secondary things to consider, primary being the concepts and the content this book offers."
"Cengage books are the best if you want to prepare for jee. I have already gone through many books for physics, chemistry & maths like arihant, m.l. khanna, dc pandey but I really found cengage books very much useful. Every topic is explaiined well & also contains illustrations and solved examples which really help a lot. If you are thinking to buy this book, just don t waste your time thinking and purchase the whole set of books for PCM.
Thanks Flipkart & Cengage publications......"
"
 Recommended to all those who are preparing for jee...
A very heplful book
I have ordered it few day ago...This new edition is worth buying.It removes misconceptions and the main part jee advance and main are separated according to syllabus and it has solutions to exercises. "
"i have done rotational mechanics part from this book.i am comfortable with that chapter now. problems given are excellent they help you to build up confidence.if you are not good at rotational mechanics you can go for this. other topics are not so good.but still you can judge you can solve problems from this book."

"Only outlined theory is present and the objectives are basic type.. you cannot crack NEET by the virtue of this book. The question papers of previous examination in the last pages are just fine. The book looks thick, but has got nothing new inside it."
"
 The content of the book is very less..... very less about the topic, very less mcqs ... i think there could be much more in this book....
i prefer not to use this book...... u may rather try arihants.... those r really good.. :) 
THANK U.... "
"
 it is best book for preparation of Aiims and Aipmt . Good study material
good description 
best ever book 
limitation
low quantity of questions "
"Buying Books online is risky cause i dont know in what way it is written. But buying this book is value for money."
"This book enables a student to know a topic superficially without going deep into it. A theoretical book i wouldn t suggest to anyone because some vital topics are missing. But some topics are very well explained."
"I purchased this book,because I thought the book would be IIT standards,but it is not like that. Also there are so many typo mistakes in this book,the same question has been solved twice in many chapters.The theory is not in detail."
"please go through this book if any one want to clarify their concept in organic chemistry as well as to grasp the best concept in organic chemistry. no other book will give such sound knowledge of organic chemistry. if you do not believe then first solve this book and then go through the question bank of any exam i assure that no one will face any problem in solving the problem as i have experienced of having solve these kind of problem thanks."
"
 well opt for this book only if ur preparing for IIT-ADV and not for IIT-MAINS.
TO HIGH LEVEL CONCEPT BUT ENJOYED IT COMPLETELY. "
"1.It has self explanatory problems without any theory.
2.Best for JEE preparation. For isomerism itself it has 480 MCQ problems. 
3.Has no theory at all. 
4.It covers quite a large portion of JEE organic syllabus but not the whole of it."
"these books go beyond limits of school curriculum and that s what i need. used it for nsejs. found it a bit helpful. to me any book which contributes to my solving of even one question is excellent
and this one is awesome.perhaps full solutions to some numerical swold have helped a lot"
"This book is awesome! This book contains every aspect of class 9th physics in detail. This book has the capability of clearing every doubt that you have. I recommend every student who want to score well in their competitive exams to buy this book."
"Book is really good and is worth buying ! I ordered this book through seller Future Got the book in excellent condition and delivery was done before expected date as usual. If you are preparing for competitive exams then you should buy this book ! Worth Buying"
"
 Lot of mistakes in the book, fundamental mistakes and printing also. 
Not recommended buy,even though a Pearson publications "
"This book makes Chemistry like never before. Although it is based on the NCERT textbook, it explains the chapters concept-to-concept. It can also be used as an reference book to some extent. It is an useful book for the ones aspiring for IIT."
"As a chemistry student myself i think this was the right book for a young kid who is entering the world of chemistry to start off ....simple...systematic...quizzical...a good beginning for a 12year old to have.."
"very nice ... i gave it to my bro ..... he has done it completely //..... there are ,many Q ,,,, good book .... recommend it .. for basics and 7th grade"
"Are the questions MCQs or Theory questions..?? If it is theory questions then this is the book i am looking for ...:)I actually really like this book.. Its wonderful but im researching Im really eager to buy this great book"
"This book is a very useful book for olympiads,ntse and other competitive exams and of course, IIT aspirants. It explains the concepts in a very simple and easy way. It can also be used as a reference book to some extent. It also contains exercises to enable the students to be able to test their concepts."
"this book contains all the question of imo and iit.i think everybody should buy this book.it is very knowledgeable"
"This book is a very useful book for olympiads,ntse and other competitive exams and of 
course, IIT aspirants. It explains the concepts in a very simple and easy way. It can also be 
 used as a reference book to some extent. It also contains exercises to enable the 
 students to be able to test their concepts."
"This book is harassing ..it is costly for its CD....buy any other publisher s..it has insufficient questions to practice.it doesnt contain any previous year question.waste of money.
if you want to test your accuracy and speed then its software is somehow helpful."
"Don t buy this book at all.
Its just Money Waste. No good exercises(with incomplete answers as well).
Pearson Tag doesn t make this book good.Buy any other book but don t buy his one.
It has only theory which is of least need when practice is main."
"
 it has all 5 subjects in it including english nd reasoning...it has nice CD with lots of mock tests in it...theory is easy to understand with lots of solved examples...it also has all practice questions solved...
its all in all a nice book for bitsat preparation... 
best of luck to all my friends preparing for this year engg exam.. "
"since this book is a pearson book it has the best of material but.. also since its the first edition it contains a lot of mistakes and also it doesn t contains previous years papers
but again it will provide a great base to the knowledge needed for bitsat"
"All of the pearson books are incapable of leading us to success in entrance examination..Please never depend on this publishers. Buy books of HC verma and other reputed authors avoid this pearson books.."
"a very good book from atul singhal... it has all the neccessary facts for iitjee.... but a little bit explanation of mechanisms is missing,,,.. but its objective questions are really good... this book is app for revision where u can go through the concepts and attempt good question.... for detailed mechansims i prefer solomons n fryhle for iitjee... but still its a great attempt by atul singhal..."
"
 This book gives all the basic knowledge of 11th and 12th standard at 10th class and that too in a very simple language.
The level of questions is simply good, starting from easy questions to hard and tough questions.
If you want to confirm it, then go to google books and type the name of the book and you get a preview of few pages of the book, it can might help you. "
"There is a demand for this book in market. So I request you to replace the book.This book will be very useful for my examinations. So please replace this book \ The I.I.T Foundation Series - Physics Class 10 2nd edition . within 2 days."
"This is an awesome book presented by pearson for preparation of olympiyard. 
Pro s-
includes syllabus of both cbse and icse board.
every topic has been made very clear"
"Its a good books you will get all the information yo ll ever want.I very desperate to get the book.The Delivery is taking too much time They better hurry up"
"go fr it guys....there are so many tricky questions in the book which you would love to solve ( if u like maths...:P ) 
 ."
"This book is very good in regarding with questions but theory part is limited and also not up to mark so you have to use another book for that. May be of arihant. The solutions is provided to each question and i think very cleary .so go for it but remember only for question and their solutions"
"
 full of printing errors 
otherwise content is good.............................................!!
questions are good..........................!!
explanations are very easy to understand.........................................................!! "
"This book is one the best books available in the market for students aiming for JEE. It covers almost all topics required for JEE explained in a language that can be understood easily. And the additional feature of this book is its content of vast experimental data which is not available in other books. And a special emphasis is laid on topics of Chemical bonding and Complex compounds which are very much essential in view of examination."
"This is a very nice book for JEE and engineering aspirants. This is very helpful in preparing for the exam. This book will help you to develop approach to solve a problem at faster rate. I will highly recommend this book for JEE."
"this book covers the syllabus in a systematic manner and aims to familiarize students with the current trends in the examination. The multiple-choice questions in the book have been arranged in different categories solved examples, questions with multiple choices, comprehension type questions, matrix-match type questions, statement-reason type questions and unsolved subjective questions. This book offers valuable insights into the authors unique teaching methodologies, his impeccable command on concepts and their applications, and his authoritative approach to the strategies required to succeed in the JEE."
"One must buy this book for preparation of iitjee. This book contain a new fresh lot of problems which can not be found in other books. Standards of those problems are very good."
"the book contains nice collection of questions but have crux points of the chapter . some of its answers are wrong!!!"
"this book has got really good ques...perfect for iit jee preparation....better than arihant series....this is not the book for theory.... i would suggest ( HC verma and this book ) - ur ticket to iit.....MTG books are also good for concept building..."
"There is no theory discussed at all. No hints or solution for exercise. Just bunch of garbage questions. Just stick to Irodov and Resonance, Bansal Test series."
"complete waste of money.. not very impressive.. there are other better books like arihant. tata mcgrow..for Jee ( Mains & Advanced ) in this book single option and more than one option questions are mixed up.. very difficult to differentiate.. answer keys are just given .. exercise is totally unsolved... ..there are few solved scattered descriptive problem which you often get in standard books.. no theory is discussed.....please do not buy the book.. service and delivery of flipkart was good as always."
"All the problems are of iitjee standard and it is a good practice book. I just wonder when its next part will come out. For all iit aspirants i would say that this book is better than Arihant new pattern iit physics."
"
 with a humongous number of queations this is all u need for craking jee level questions. 
a true master piece. excellent statement-assertion questions.
Abhay sir is a great teacher and is a true genius. "
"The earlier verson of this book was a piece of waste. Horrible spelling mistakes makes the reading uncomfortable. Please never buy this thing. Use arihant or other publishers. Keep distance from this book"
"Well indeed its a very good book. Few tips and tricks are good, and the specialty of this book is each sum is new of its own kind.. But be prepared with your school s prescribed text book before u start this one, since this book is not for starters. U can surely crack state JEE s if u even solve 60% of the sums by own."
"
 I would recommend this book for JEE Main. It has many shortcuts techniques which you will need in exam. It has a adequate number of solved questions and practice questions, and almost every question is new. As you go through the book it will impart confidence in you. But do it after your text book..
I used this book and got 115/120 in Maths in JEE Main 2013 "
"The cover say sumthing bout JEE but as they say dont judge a book by its cover such is the case with it.You can buy this book if u want to practice solving a large no of question in short time for tests like AIEEE but having said this the quality of questions are really not up to the mark.For those who aim for JEE its of really no use!!!!!"
"mismatch of solution number to question number. Besides, it seems books is released in a hurry, instead of preparing in orderly fashion. Lot needs to be improved"
"This book is very useful written by ganguly sir who has the ultimate power to guide u in chemistry. I am proud to have him as my chemistry teacher i. 11th and 12 th"
"This book is most useful for a quick time revision. Contains many question like subjective , multiple,statement type etc.. There are many points for quick revision. Its most recommended. Shipped in 2 days."
"Summarised theory, a very well written book. One can do all the questions at the back without hesitation because answers are provided, a one stop solution for grasping JEE concepts."
"Summarised theory, a very well written book. One can do all the questions at the back without hesitation because answers are provided, a one stop solution for grasping JEE concepts."
"ITS A USELESS BOOK , NO PROPER AND FULL EXPLANATIONS OF THE CONCEPTS.ITS BETTER TO BUY AN ARIHANT BOOK FOR THIS.A WASTE OF MONEY. I SUGGEST YOU ALL NOT TO WASTE MONEY ON THIS BOOK. INSTEAD BUY ARIHANT OR CENGAGE BOOK FOR PHY CHEM"

"This book seems very helpful to me. I think anyone who wants to learn and study about the organic mechanisms should follow this book properly."
"
 Morrison & boyd always rokz....and sonal rajora added a MCQ flavour to it.....
Best book in organic chemistry for any JEE aspirants.. "
" 
The content of the book is very good....though the quality of the book is not satisfactory for the price. "
"World fame Morrison Boyd gets a nasty form in this book. Sonal Rajora has done a good work by adding some objective questions at the end of the chapters but this is simply not good enough for aspiring IITians or Chemists as it dangerously lacks detailed reactions mechanism that can be found in Solomons edited by Ms Chouhan. However this book is not completely out of the business."
"I am not a Chemistry lover, however I found Morrison & Boyd interesting. I used this book in high school for about 50% percent of the Chemistry syllabus in school&JEE related to organic chemistry. The style of the authors was refreshing, and I found it easy to read large sections in short periods. I also found it easy to recall a lot of points as the book was written in such a way as to lead you from one point to the other, which style is the best for organic chemistry."
"This book does not contain many important reactions of the jee syllabus,rather buy solomon and frhyle(indian edition by Ms chouhan)."
"its an all in one type. after buying this, i don t think there s any need to refer to any other book for concepts. go for this. certainly worth the money."
"I ve used this book and find it completely useless, this book is designed for those who have extra time to study, further NCERT & JEE content is mixed up , also number of questions per chapter are very less ranging from 10-30. Those who are looking for reference should not buy this book.
Only students with high level of understanding would find it useful"
"really helps in building concepts..
and Advance Level Of Question for practice 
 and Helpful for strong and weak students both"
"This the best ever textbook on I.C.Engines & Jet propulsion so far i have gone,through contents in this book are easy to understand & plenty of numerical problems are also available for practice.This book is also very usefulfor preparing competitive exams like GATE TANCET."
"This is a good book written in a lucid language to begin with the subject. A lots of numericals are there to clear the basic concepts well enough.Diagrams are there with easy illustration to make a good foundation.Perfect book for diploma and undergraduate students of mechanical and automobile engineering.Also very helpful for competitive examinations like GATE,UPSC ENGG SERVICES etc as well as helpful for AMIE SECTION B examination."
"It is very useful book for student of mechanical engineering. Flipkart service is really outstanding. So, you can easily trust the service offered by flipkart. I have received the book in proper time and proper condition."
"It is a really nice book covering all the chapters of manufacturing.This book will be helpful for students of nearly all indian university.It is also helpful for competitive exams.There are lots of theory as well as problems in the end of each chapters."
"Very basic book, even with wrong and vague information. I will not recommend it. Don t go for cheap price."
"
 None of the three is Water/Waste Water Expert .
Are they Professional Copy & Paste Experts ?
This is a Shame to Engineers in General
 &
 Engineering Teaching Fraternity...... "
"when i got this book in my hands,i got big Wow by looking it.The contenet provided is very clear topicwise . Its objectives are very specific to the topic. I think its better then R.s khurmi book.If you are apllying for any competitive examination and have less time then you must buy this book.And happy with flipcarts offer on this book.but when i buy this buk it was of 438 Rs from here,but now its 478 Rs. Best of luck."
"The book includes almost all objective type questions covered detailed in all topics. One backdrop is the problems are not solved. and u cant find the summary for critical questions. Over all the book is fine and found only some printing mistakes. Go for it. U can add some knowledge to the existing. Good luck"
"CONTAINS EACH AND EVERY IMPORTANT TOPIC RELATED TO MECHANICAL ENGINEERING............................................................................................"
"great book for PSU aspirants...questions are from basic concepts...very helpfull for those who are preparing for SSC JE & PSC etc."
"This book is good. The content is simple and important points are listed. Some topics like fluid mechanics, machine design are covered in detail. Every chapter has 400-500 objective questions for sure and they have high probability in being asked in PSU exams. Yet important and vast areas like production engineering, heat and mass transfer, industrial engineering are very limited (only 2 or 3 pages). If you just want objective questions to be thoroughly prepared without the content for understanding concepts, you can jolly well buy this book. If you content explanation for all chapters in detail, try other books. However this book is good and useful."
"This book was really helpful for me. It covers almost everything related to Mechanical Engineering. It is a must have book if you want to recall your engineering by means of objective type. You need much patience to reach the questions prolonged in the book. Short handouts and topics related to subjects are diversified. I found this book really helpful."
"
 This book along with Khurmi and Rattan makes a perfect combination. Rattan has problems of considerable difficulty this book has 50% A.M.I.E exam question.These questions are much tricky and lengthy than of university questions.
But problems are of standard quality. "
"yes... this is the best book of theory of machine. i like this book very much. the main quality of this book is language is so soft and easy to capture fast.and all syllabus covered of theory of amchine in this book."
"this book is very important book for all civil engineers to prepare themselves for competitive examinations & also recall all the important topics of civil engineering."
"
 Lots of quality objective questions,fill in the blanks, matching type questions etc. with answers. But solutions of a very few questions are given in this book, so that is a shortcoming that I felt. Regardless it is a good book for preparation. 
If you are thinking of buying it and Go for it!!. It is one of the best books available in the market for Competitions. "
"if u buy this it is very useful for engineers and this book very useful at any moment and you can revise this book for IAS ,UPSC , SSC , GATE , and any other competitions for mechanical engineers........"

"this is awesome in its quality and its content. The content wise area are covered in depth for even the dull students. It provides with one of the best solutions at an affordable way and understandable. The material of the book is good when it is compared with the rest. I think the must haves for the competitive exams that are laid on one s life. It is the ready made kit that can be presented at a cheap cost."
"Thus is a average book useful only for diploma questions........ 
Each chapter contains 100 question of average level....
Serious suggestion don t go it"
".. it was very nice book for banking and also useful for other competitive exams.. really flipkart done a good job in delivery issue.."
"This book according to me is a source of excellency in physics entrance preparation books.It again proves that dinesh publications publishes the exact book required by the students.Dinesh objective physics has enough number of questions for practice along with its perfect brief review.As far as service of flipkart is concerned,its highly efficient packaging and delivery management impresses me everytime.I recommend this book for every medical/engg. aspirant.Love you flipkart!!!"
"
 I purchased this book with the recommendation of my coaching teacher....and it has proved to be very much helpful, though if u compare the matter in NCERT with is book.....u will find a huge gap but...u have to bridge this to crack PMTs, AIIMS , NEET and other such exams.....many many extra this are provided in the book with an objective approach....i personally liked it a lot.............the question bank is awesome.....rather its HUGE......as a whole this book is a must for cracking medical entrances .....
I strongly recommend this book for the medical aspirants..... "
"This book has all info required for NEET. I think that question bank is sufficient but it should be organised according to different difficulty levels. Presentation and layout are excellent and price is also competent."
"This book helps you a lot and covers the portion also for iit jee examination.so i got the max benefit from this book.excellenttttttttttttttttttt bookkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk.You can also crack any competitions by reading this book"
"PROS:-
1) Theory explanations.
2) Question Bank.(veryyyy vast amount of questions)
3) Covers all the topics of Physical chem.
4) Excellent questions.
5) IIT Trainer.
6) Cheap
========================================================
CONS:-
1) Fat
2) Difficult to understand.
3) Explanations are a bit complex.
4) Practice questions are tougher than expected.
5) Not fit for SELF STUDY.
========================================================
CONCLUSION:-
this book is very good for training you in physical chemistry but certainly not the best.
very soon you will get bored. questions given for practice are tougher as theory and examples are not much related with it. 
but this book has tried to explain the concepts of physical chemistry in the best possible way a book can."
"Simply put,a no-nonsense book that makes you work towards mastery of the concepts of Physical Chemistry and honing them while solving the very well organised numericals in the book.And the effort put in shows.....when it matters."
"I used this book when i was preparing for JEE. Learning steps in other subjects include understanding the theory and then solving problems whereas in physical chemistry its the other way around. You need to practice more and more to understand the concepts.
Once you understand the basics well then solving problems from this book becomes fun. You need to master the early chapters well to get comfortable in the later chapters of this book.
A must-have for competitive exam aspirants."
"Just go get your copy of the book and be blown away by its essence.This book might make you addicted to Physical Chemistry. So my dear friends dont think, just buy it.It explains physical chemistry through the concept of mole,hence making it simple to understand and there are numerous examples to get you running along."
"This is a kind of BOOKKK.... recommended by every teacher and student....But i thought what is so special about this BOOK? according to me it was an ordinary BOOK.But as it was suggested by my teacher, so i decided to get this BOOK from d best known FLIPKRT!After placing the order,i got d BOOK in only 2 days due to flipkart s fastest delivery.But as i considered it to be an ordinary BOOK so i kept it at d corner of my table beneath all my books.i didn t even bother to open the BOOK.But one day in my leisure time SUDDENLY i decided to have a look at the BOOK...........and what i found was unimaginable...its a huge surprise......CAN u guess what it was?If NO then find it at once....GET this BOOK now HURRRRRYYYY....Don t wait ,just"
"A good book for students who wish to master chemistry. I suggest that you do not blame the book and work hard. Beautifully presented. A must for all students."
"there are many steps shown about the calculations in the the suma which were not given in other bks!!!! and overall a good bk for chem"
"Questions in each chapter (total 20+2) are about 50-60 subjective and around 40-50 objective.Their average is the no.of solved examples per chapter.Level of objective questions is not as good as subjective,At end of book about 400-500 questions each of objective and subjective is given.Theory is brief but to the point. Doesn t deals with Surface Chemistry Rest is enough for jee"
"coming to physical chemistry I often doubt where it ends.To put every question that is in this chapter the book will be like it would be carried by cranes and trucks.But in this case this book is small like a pocket book and have many problems which I am currently busy solving so much theory.If you want to clear your doubts in physical chemistry donot look anywhere buy this buddy :)"
"
 The best book I would refer to anyone who wants to learn chemistry from the basics to the toppers level
Amazing book
Great book
Read and enjoy "
"firstly this book is for those who love mathematics and completed there ML khanna or RD sharma or arihant or TMH. this books really contains very high quality questions.this book contain totally 7 topics and each topic have 10-12 sub-topic.this book will help you to use your concept knowledge and theory knowledge to solve problems.this is must buy book who want to revise there mathematics skills. and beginners please don t buy this books. this will be very hard for you.and not much problems are solved and exercise only have answer,answer are didn t gave in brief. but end news is this books is very good for revision after your preparation not for beginners."
"This book covers all the theory (over and above standard 12th class knowledge) required for cracking the engineering competitive exams. The questions are of really high quality. You first need to have solid grasp of basics before attempting this book, as this book takes up the student from the basics to the advanced knowledge, rigor and practice required for engineering exams. This makes a worthy companion to other high quality books published Bharathi Bhawan (HC Verma s Concept of Pysics book, Physics/Chem/Maths MCQ)."
"The book has wide range of quality tough questions and jusr enough practice in unsolved, not to much not too less. I specially like the chapter tests given at the end with a time constraint whoch will challenge the student.
Over all a book for those who are preparing for jee advanced. 
P.s. The book requries the student to have the ability to solve average questions, n then only can one give a. Das a try."
"This book covers almost all topics which are usually asked in the IITJEEs. But you will not find sufficient theory in this book which one has to be familiar with in order to solve the problems. At the beginning of each and every chapter, the book supplies us with Recap of Necessary Facts and Formulae . The results mentioned here are, no doubt, highly conceptual..but it will be extremely difficult for the student to derive those results themselves. If you are familiar with all those results and hunting for challenging problems like those asked in IITJEE, this book is a must for you. Containing above 3000 problems, this book covers a wide range of problems ranging from easy to challenging. Unlike the MCQ book of ADG, none of the problems are provided with an explanatory solution, merely the answer is given. In a nutshell, if you are an expert...this book is a must but if you are a beginner, this book will be of no help to you !"
"Hat s off to Flipkart...the book was delivered within 48 hours and that also to a tier-3 city...The book is already a classic...best book for revision if you have completed the portion and have 2 to 3 months for revision....Go for this book and ur lyf will change forever :-)"
"THIS BOOK IS JUST AWESOME.IT HAS GOT ALL IT HAS TO HAVE FOR A STUDENT TO CRACK IIT JEE EXAM.THE LEVEL OF THE SUMS HERE AND THE ILLUSTRATIONS IS MORE THAN ENOUGH TO CLEAR YOUR CONCEPTS.IF YOU ARE THINKING OF BUYING THIS BOOK THEN GO FOR IT BECAUSE IT IS WORTH BUYING........."
"
 this is a very nice book! gr8 questions and love the time management test!! But,this book can be used only if u have a sound BASIC knowledge of the topics as it takes them to a whole new level.
But good for revision!!:D "
"
 Myself ,being an iit aspirant, wanted some good books for the purpose .Heard a lot of this book and finally purchased it...
According to me, MUST BUY book who want to excel in the subject..
Good for engineering entrance Examinations....
Everything is done in details, provided with a lot of examples...
Believe me , A FANTASTIC BOOK !!!!
JUST GO FOR IT AND EXPERIENCE IT !!!!!!!!! "
"The book has a large number of questions, most subjective. The questions are generally of high standard and there are no solutions give for them. The book also consists of solved examples."
"This is very good book for IIT JEE and JEE MAIN. All the topics are very well and good sum are in each topic."
"This was one of my first book from flipkart. I wasn t sure whether I will get this or not, so i preferred to choose the COD option. The delivery as usual was quick which really impressed me.
The book has a lot of single and multiple type MCQ for various chapters with help at the end. This books makes a complete revision for a chapter. Although, I felt that the physical chemistry part was relatively easier."
"The book is compiled in a very good manner for the starters. I feel it could help in a great way for the readers who wants to practice wide range of MCQ questions."
"Good Book... Suffiecient number of questions of each chapter...................................................................."
"This books is quite good for wide range of mcqs and has some great iit level questions too. Useful for begineers like me. Flipkarts service was okay but the book could have a better binding. so for books i will give 5 stars but for binding 3..."
"As a teacher of Mathematics for IIT-Jee, I have recommended this book for practice, to my serious students of IIT-Jee, BIT-SAT and other Engineering Entrance Exams and I have seen their performance improve drastically. 
This book has helped many students of mine to perform better in the exams. 
A must for the students of all the Engineering Entrance Exams."
"All IIT-JEE student should follow this book after getting sounding knowledge .Objectives are very good & challenging."
"Best thing about the book is the variety of questions it provides with hardly any error. Questions are of all levels, though there are not even 60 questions under some topic but you don t need them if you solve all other questions. I d definitely recommend this book especially to those who like to prepare topics by tackling questions."
"nice questions for entrance exams of JEE MAINS level. questions in very organised way. covers most of the type of problems of JEE MAINS standard. Disappointed with the delivery, took almost a week to deliver this book."
"This is a very powerful book.It is a helpful book also.Questions,hints are beautifully arranged and so helpful.Thanks to the author of the book,A.Das Gupta for give us this book."
"Best book for an IIT-JEE aspirant(in my opinion). The questions are very good quality and arranged so beautifully... Thanks to sir Asit Das Gupta for a good gift for us........."
"One of the best books out there for any JEE Main and Advanced aspirant apart from other exams. The hints are sometimes complicated but a great buy altogether. New chapters have been added in comparison to the previous editions. And there s nothing to say about Flipkart s delivery; its good as usual"
"THIS BOOK IS A VERY NICE BOOK FOR JEE MAINS AND ADVANCED IT COVERS ALL THE TOPICS FROM BASICS TO A COMPLEX LEVEL IT HAS TWO LEVELS 1 AND 2. ,LEVEL 2 COMPRISES OF ADVANCED LEVEL PROBLEMS .THE BEST PART OF THE BOOK IS THAT IT CONTAINS HINTS TOO.ONE MUST BUY THIS BOOK IF HE/SHE IS PREPARING FOR JEE ,BITSAT OR OTHER ENGINEERING ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS."
"
 This was my first book from Flipkart.
The book is really helpful....nicely sorted problems on different topics and the level of difficulty eventually increases....!!
Hints and solutions to selected questions add the feather in the cap..!! "
"Its s a good book for studying IIT/AIEEE mathematics and it covers all concepts. Its is really helpful for other entrance exams too. Though you need to know the formulae and concepts of the chaps to be able to solve."
"
 This book is great for all those who have gifted minds, but for people with average intelligence like me this book is real difficult to solve 
Said that, if at all u are able to solve all of its questions and mostly w/o peeping into hints, then my friend cracking IIT (assuming u have solved books on chemistry by M.S Chouhan; N. Awasthi & R.C Mukhrejee) is just a walk in the park. 
I would recommend that u use H.C Verma for understanding the theory part. 
Hope this was useful. 
:) "
"
 Hi all
A goodbook indeed! start doing it after you have learnt the whole of mechanics only or u will not understand anything!Have fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> "
"Good for those who have done H C Verma and require more practice...not recommended for those who have tried books like Irodov."
"
 IT IS THE BEST MCQ BOOK FOR PRACTICING PURPOSE OF ENTRANCE EXAMS LIKE IIT-JEE.
THE BOOK CONTAIN MANY BRAIN TEASING PROBLEMS ALONG WITH NECESSARY HINTS & SOLUTIONS. IT CAN TRULY BE CALLED A GREAT BOOK BY BHARTI BHABHAN.
JUST GO FOR IT TO GET A OVERALL BETTER SCORE. "
"
 Conceptual book. very good price 
very good, and a must must have book.
Do first Ncert and then do this. "
"
 Are you searching for all the past questions of IIT in physics, then this is no bad an option.
All questions are good and perfect solutions "
"The book covers almost all Physics topics required for the preparation for any entrance examination. There are sufficient number of MCQs with proper hints and answers. I wish there were more, but nonetheless the book is comprehensive. Also, practice tests are a good addition."
"the questions in this book are just awesome.. one needs to know the concepts very well to enjoy this book..of course will help to make ur physics more stronger.."
"I was just looking forward to this kind of a book! The one will not unlawfully challenge the students might but will definitely put them to test. At the end one will emerge confident and with a finely tuned understanding! Good work. Thanks to all involved."
"This book may appear to be short, and may have less MCQ s , but the MCQ s are to highten your problem solving skills in physics and they are critical. One should buy this book. It is better to solve this book and remember them, than to buy heavy books and practicing thousands of MCQ s only."
"book has very good collection of revising notes and M.C.Qs along with their solutions 
very good for revision"
"this guide will play a very important role in my AIEEE preparations. rahul sharma of IIT Kharagpur has written it. found it very helpful. he truly understands what students need. it helped me by clearing my basic concepts of maths. i don t think other guides of this type are there in market. i recommend this guide to every1 preparing for aieee maths. there are more guides of the series. all r good."
"Before purchasing any book we need a good review about the book. Ratings alone are not sufficient and neither is only the summary of the book. In absence of reviews it would be extremely handy if the contents of the book are given as they appear in the index. This would better help buyers to determine whether to buy the book or not. Thank you."
"This book is quiet good for GD preparation. It covers some important topics that can come in a GD inclusive of some vital topics too. However GD topic in a process cannot be predicted as there re lot of topics available for the recruiters or hosts. But this book consists tips and techniques to be a successful cracker of GD e.g. how to conduct during GD, how to behave with other candidates etc. This book will help anyone a lot."
"Ok, basically no single book about gd or PI would satisfy my hunger so I got three (two from my friends- a good combo.) This 1 s more like a key to provide u quick answers to all topics n yes, it has lots of topics! u read it n u can say somethin about anything... Another 1 I have has more of mock gds but few topics, while 3rd, the cheapest 1 is totally useless. I m convinced no book, Indian or International can be a complete book on gd, there4 I ll advice u all to read from more than 1. And don t 4get to surf net for good stuff n videos! Better b careful than lose a seat, no? Gotta study 4 CAT also! Tc!"
"Price is a little high (thatz why taking out 1 star) but the book is helpful.It covers more topics than any book I found on GD. most important feature is of course abstract topics. No unnecessary details, easy to understand points, will be helpful in PI also. Liked it."
"Very general topics and in none of the discussions you will find facts...waste of time and money...the points given in each topic are just plain common sense without concrete supporting examples or facts.Good book for high school students."
"Amazingly well-researched, and brilliant prose as well.
The style of writing also helps in easy reading.
Sharma s writing is so addictive and so helpful.
Point to point help to begin and end discussion.
Important point makes it something that lives with you forever. 
awesome"
"PLEASE DON T BUY THIS HORRIBLE BOOK AT ALL. 
MY SISTER STUDIED THE WHOLE BOOK FOR
NATA 
EXAMINATION
BUT AMAZINGLY 
NOT A SINGLE QUESTION TYPE WAS ALSO NOT MATCHING WITH THE EXAMINATION PAPER. 
SO I WOULD SAY THAT 
PLEASE DON T WASTE YOR MONEY ON THIS STUFF"
"
 This book is useless for NATA and JEE. It is better to look for another book.
This book is not just a waste of money, it is a waste of time and paper.
Please dont buy this book. There are many other books on flipkart for preparation of NATA and JEE. 
Thanks. "
"This book s name is Phy Dictionary, and it covers almost all topics from 11 and 12th Standard. it s good for exam time, everything is in short. But it has some minor printing mistakes. but, What u expect in this price. it s good for 11,12th students."
"The book just contains one single page descring the pattern of 4 exams NTPC, NHPC, DRDO and IOCL which ofcourse you can get on the net. 
It does not contain a single model test paper or previous years question. 
Its not recommended for your PSU exam and is a wastage of money.Try another book."
"
 I found the book really to be very helpful for the objective examinations conducted by most of the PSUs. Its a must buy for the aspirants looking for getting into any of the elite PSUs. 
The service of the flipkart as is said by everybody is impeccable. And its getting better and better as its getting more popular shoping online. Keep up FK. "
"Dont buy Any RPH publication or R.gupta book of any Trade or competition. They have provided only previous paper and solved with lots of Errors. Go for gk publications or Kiran prakashan or BSC publications."
"Wrost book for preperation i hve ever used...i will suggest to all the new buyers tht don t waste money................................................................................................................................................"
"the book is not at all systematic, you will get confused. the multiple questions are all mixed up. eg in the communication section questions on transmission lines, satellite communication, AM, FM, TV and Video etc are all mixed up. it may be good for revision and test. i wish the theory and questions are given topic wise."
"i have buy this book from flipkart.com. in this book just a basic of ece. and other part i.e mcq. thanks.............................................................................................................................................................."
"those who ar in studies they ar trying to do their best in maths as per my concept. so if u hope to do best in coordinate geometry then u should use this book .this book is awesome and the language in which it is written is very very easy to understand."
"a vey good book,everything is explained in detail.it include concepts of conics,straight line and many other in very lucid manner .also flipkart services are trustworthy and shipment service is very reliable..."
"very bad, seems like some one has copied on note pad and printed the same on paper,does not seem like a book.. no figures or drawings explaining.."
"This is one of the greatest book for class IX. You will get everything and lot of practice. But it is bit hard and concept would not be clear very easy. Therefore I would advise you to have some basic knowledge first and then refer but still is is very good book for class IX."
"
 This BOOK is simply a masterpiece written by Mr. Ashish Arora!
Honestly speaking.....as per my view...this book actually outshines DC
Pandey and Concepts of Phy by HC Verma....this is way too good...Very interesting and most of the topics have been included!!
JUST GO FOR IT!! "
"it is one of the few books for modern physics which takes you on a journey of quantum world in a lucid way. It is very easy to apprehend. Ample of solved and unsolved problem to practice. So, without a hesitation you go for this as modern physics is a very important topic in JEE ADV as about every year at least 5 questions are asked."
"This book is so worse. i suggest to everybody if anybody gives this book for free then also don t take it. i think this was the best thing that i can tell you about this book. sites like flipkart doesn t sell books like this."
"Few days back i ordered this book in the hope that it will fulfil my requirement but it was a total waster.
It contains lots of problem but with no solution, not even a single solution is provided, no description is provided and in some case no answer is provided, it is simply marked with (?).
Total waste of money.
All GK publication are just waste of money.."
"
 do not buy this book totally useless ....copied topics and the level is really down 
silly questions with wrong answer ....if u blindly follow this book u will definitely fail.the standard is not gate but a matric level "
"Introduction: 
I happened to first see this book in a local book fair when I was a plus two student more than a decade ago. Seniors and my teacher used to recommend this book for the most challenging problems one could find. I immediately picked up a copy. In those days, it was the favourite book for students who used to take the IIT JEE. 
More than a decade later, I am a Physics teacher. The format of the IIT-JEE has changed a lot, and these days, the book isn t that much of a favourite among plus two students as it does not contain any MCQs. However, to me, the book has come even closer to me and I still get a high when I happen to solve a few cool problems. 
Whom is this book for: 
This book is primarily meant for plus two students. However, judging the level of difficulty of the problems, any Physics lover at any level should fall in love with it. Ideally, you should start with the problems in plus two and by the time you finish your Bachelors, you should have completed it. 
Organization of the book: 
The book is divided into six parts: 
1. Mechanics: Kinematics, Dynamics, Conservation Laws, Gravitation, Rigid Body Dynamics, Elasticity, Hydrodynamics, Relativistic Mechanics 
2. Thermodynamics and Molecular Physics: Equations of state and Processes, First law and heat Capacity, Kinetic Theory and Maxwell Boltzman distribution, Entropy and the Second law, Surface tension, Phase Transitions, Transport Phenomena 
3. Electrodynamics: Constant Electric Field in Vacuum, Conductors and Dielectrics, Capacitance and Energy in an Electric Field, Current Electricity, Magnetostatics, EM Induction and Maxwell s Equations, Motion of Charged Particles in Electric and Magnetic Fields. 
4. Oscillations and Waves: Mechanical Oscillations, Electric Oscillations, Elastic waves: Acoustics, EM waves and radiation 
5. Optics: Photometry and Geometrical Optics, Interference, Diffraction, Polarization, Dispersion and Absorption, Optics of Moving Sources, Thermal Radiation and Quantum nature of Light. 
6. Atomic and Nuclear Physics: Scattering of Particles: Bohr-Rutherford atom, Wave properties of particles: Schrodinger Equation, Properties of atoms and Atomic Spectra, Molecules and Crystals, Radioactivity, Nuclear Reactions, Elementary Particles. 
In my opinion, the organization of the book is very logical. 
About the quality of the problems: Most of the problems require very clear thinking. You will hardly get any plug and chug problem. Some problems are indeed very demanding and require you to use several concepts. This was the reason why this book was so popular for IIT-JEE and is still a favourite for Physics Olympiads. Some reviewer has called this book a good workout for the brain. I couldn t agree more with him/her. 
How to use this book: First be very clear about the theory that you need for solving these problems. You should get that from any standard book. Choose your favourite: HC Verma, Resnick and Halliday or Sears and Zemansky. 
Irodov has also written two other tiny books on Mechanics and Electrodynamics. You can get these. They are excellent too. You can take help from them. 
After this, you should be able to do at least many of the problems, but maybe not all. The second stage is to put on your thinking caps and yes, don t forget to consult with your friends or teachers. With hard work, you should be able to do a substantial number of problems. Good luck! 
This book deserves nothing short of 5 stars! However, as you may have noticed, this book is available from many publishers like CBS, GK and maybe others too. The quality of the printing, the pages and the binding varies. I have noticed, the one from GK is a bit weak on the printing side. However, they offer it at the cheapest price (Rs 58 at the time of writing from flipkart, though the MRP was Rs 100). This book was originally published by Mir Publishers, Moscow which I guess has vanished after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. This publisher has given us many many quality books starting from the school level. India has benefited enormously from the close association we had with the erstwhile USSR till the eighties and early nineties. This book is a product of love from a country which has produced marvellous physicists for the world. 
About the author: Not much is known about him unfortunately. But I gather he spent years if not decades to make a course of theoretical Physics. He has written 4 books on Nuclear Physics, Mechanics and Electrodynamics and the present one. All of them except the Nuclear Physics one are available even now. You can search on google for a pdf of the Nuclear Physics book. All the books are of excellent quality. Let us pay our tributes to this great man by at least solving the problems in this book! Happy studying everyone! :)"
"This book is paradise for people who love physics challenges... a book with almost 1800 problems each more interesting than the last.. a must buy book for all physics lovers.. Every chapter has a formula list and hints are provided at the back to some extent"
"
 This book contains as many as 1800 questions on virtually every topic of physics. Some are easy but most will take a tough test of your brain. 
I will recommend this book to -
*students preparing for IIT-JEE.
*student who boast to be very good at physics numerical. "
"Simply awesome!...This is one of those books which helps you check your fundamental understanding of physics. You will find variety of problems covering every topic. Most of them are tough but once you solve them you will literally FALL IN LIFE LONG LOVE WITH PHYSICS. Some problems can even take days to solve but what is the fun without that? ..I first came across it during my JEE days and from there I always kept one copy with me. I strongly recommend it to the physics enthusiasts and competitive students. Though current IIT pattern don t require solving such tough problems but it s always good to be a step ahead and have clear understanding of fundas."
"It s a good book for people who are preparing for competitives."
"The problems in the book are really VERY difficult and challenging. I personally love solving this book. however, THIS BOOK CANNOT MAKE YOU A MASTER OF PHYSICS. The very first question of the book is quite difficult and the level keeps on soaring.
The level of the questions is way higher than IIT JEE and obviously JEE MAINS/AIEEE .
I m sure you can t even do a single question after completing your NCERTS/Pradeeps.
SUMMARY:
Buy this book only if you find HC Verma VERY easy, you have ample of time and you love physics.
TIPS FOR ATTEMPTING THIS BOOK:-
1) make sure your concepts are clear
2) attempt only after yo ve done difficult problems from other books like HCV
3) Solving the book can be very time consuming ( I takes me around 10-15 min per question)
4) Do not get demoralized if u r not able to solve the questions.
5) There r solutions to this book online ( on blogspot) . Look at them only after you have tried a question at least 10 times."
"Needless to say this book is the best if you are an IIT aspirant & love problem solving. You must get your concepts cleared before you solve the problems in this book or else you will never get any question right. I ordered this book a week ago. Flipkart should have delivered it by Tuesday 1st July, 2014, but the book has not arrived yet. I have been waiting for it but surprisingly my order gets automatically cancelled & I receive a message from Flipkart about the cancellation of my order. What???!! I haven t cancelled it. Instead I have been waiting for it since a week. I am very disappointed with this carelessness of Flipkart. No reply from the customer service either. Well played Flipkart, not expected from you."
"A perfect book to unleash your skills in physics.
 I.E.Irodov. ,everyone s inspiration."
"Ok this book might be famous amongst the IIT-JEE coaching crowd because it supposedly will make you a master of physics,but then it is not advisable for school students to use this book because it uses concepts much beyond even the JEE syllabus.It could be demoralising,hence a better option would be Resnick-Halliday Indian Edition."
"If you think you are good in physics, then it s worth trying. It will keep you interested in physics with many challenging questions. 
But do it only if your basics are clear."
"It was the same book we have grown up with , good book to work with, refer and learn. Liked it. The printing is not so bad. Though paper quality is not upto the mark, but material inside is the same."
"I earlier owned the same book by another publisher Radha Publishing House or some other publisher like that and the quality of the book and paper as well as print was so bad that I didn t feel like reading anything from it. This book is quite better than the other books and there is obviously isn t much to say about SL Loney s books which are always great! 
Go for this one, it will certainly help you a lot."
"
 This is one of those books which the writer has written with some spare time rather than the cut copy paste...
Those who are really aspiring to qualify for perphaps the best competitive examination in the whole world "
"The print quality is not that good,besides being too small in font,to read.After all I admit that this book is one of masterpieces of trigonometry but the book presentation and neatness of edition is not preserved,you should buy another book instead."
"This book is just under 100 bucks, and is not big; but don t be fooled, this book can intimidate you out of your senses. For people who love problem solving, yo ll absolutely love this. For those who don t, don t bother buying it, yo ll probably not get around to solving it anyway."
"the book is really good for those who have keen interest or curiosity to solve problems in calculus.it s not n exam prep. book but can be beneficial to u if you have passion to study the subject.may be it can be useful in various olympiads.however being a +2 student i can say that the whole book is not meant for +2 students but again it s good for higher studies.the only problem with the book is that it does not contain any text for pre-reading for that u have to refer mathematical analysis by af bermant.
thumbs up to flipkart for fast delivery of book."
"Don t get frightened to do questions included in it as it can ignite the spark of concepts in ur mind .U ll able to aply the concepts in ur daily life either it belongs to engineering stream or commerse.So keep ur sprit alive to purchase it.."
"If you are fed of with books like Mathematical Analysis By W. Rudin and Same title by T.M. Apostol then you must by this. As For As I concern this is a necessary book for Exams Like GATE and IAS as well as IFoS."
"Though the book contains descent questions but the level is not too high... If u r preparing for jee then go for some other...if you want a lot of command on calculas den go for it ;)"
"This is only problem book. No examples are included,so you would have to buy some other book for understanding the concepts. 
Niceyy delivery by flipkart."
"There s nothing new here that you wouldn t find in a text book. I wouldn t recommend it. Go for Terence Tao s book on Analysis. Those have fewer examples in Analysis but they really assess your understanding of the subject"
"Awesome Book But Product delivered by Flipkart in which some pages were folded and teared. Flipkart has not chosen a good book for delivey.. They should select a good and nice book so as to deliver to customers."
"It was good book. iused for the iit preparation and it helps me lot of to shake m concept which were weak at the foundation. it provide excellent questions with lot full of super quality question."
"
 Full of practice sums and keeps me in good touch with maths .. awsum buk .. !!
Thousands of questions and gives great confidence in all topics given inside ... must to solve book for all competitive exams .. !! "
"Useful book for IIT JEE sound foundation. This book is not meant for beginners, you must have good understanding of Math up to 10th Level. Printing quality of book published by G. K. Publication is bad. Book published by CBS Publisher is better quality."
"Nice Book essential for all competitive exams. It covers school syllabus well. but the solutions and explanations could have been better. Also inclusion of more solved examples would be recommended"
"those who preparing for iit dont buy this because this not cover all the topic properly Qus are not iit level"
"Well , I brought this book with lot of expectation . But it couldn t fulfill it. Though the problems may be good but not of that standard everybody expects from Russia. If your concepts are clear it would take some few days to solve it , so not useful for them .It may be good for beginners.(9th standard)
Also many important topics like graph , Mean-Value theorem , Rolle s Theorem etc are missing from this book . 
Overall , satisfactory .But not a Classic Russian book everybody expects."
"bestFirst of all, the build quality is very good. Its small, good read and write speeds, Excellent to look at. 
The only thing some might find troubling, is the fingerprints. But, they can be cleaned with a single wipe of a cloth. 
I already own one. Bought another one for.. umm.. just fun! :D 
And regarding the packing, loved it!! Carefully packed. Flipkart is the best!! Best online store to buy from, in India."
"one of the best books for basics and questions awesome book for clearing concepts on logarithms,functions,binolmials ....."
"
 Your search ends here.
THIS BOOk is all you need to revise from basic to the professional level
TRUST ME 
this book will help you in your academics for sure!!!!
even you want to revise a concept..
even you revise at 11th hour its beneficial
every detail of formula is well explained!!!
:D "
"It is a good book for Class 1 to 12 .If anybody has forget some formal and want to refresh his memory, can go for the try.Price is okay."
"Good concise book for someone who wants to freshen up their math basics. 
Flipkart s delivery is good as well, as usual. The order was delivered in just a day, in good condition."
"
 absolutely wonderful,both for entrance exam students and for teachers also...... 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pros : covers almost all types of entrance exam syllabus
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cons : 
 it would be better if the chapters came categorized under algebra,trigonometry , and such other sections..
 a little bit messed up
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- "
"this book is good for fast revision ..even on day of exam!.
because all the formula of physics is included in the book.this book not have any extra info but this book covers all physics formula. so we don t have to refer all large notes during revision and you if you are not good notes maker..it will also help you. 
all basics and advance concept have brief description and examples ans figures wherever needed. 
overall
Value for money.
You can buy it..it will sure help you."
"
 this book is the worst book i have ever seen.on the cover page it is written that formula,definitions and equations......it should be definitions,definitions,definitions.
it is written that the book can be used by iit preparing students,but beleive me guys an iitian will find garbage as a suitable place for this book. "
"ive recently ordered this book for last min prep,i really got startled goin through it,itz not at all useful or cannot contribute for prep on competitive exams,once you buy i bet you will get annoyed..this might not be useful for last min prep but can be good for goin over"
"THIS BOOK IS TOO GOOD FOR REFERENCE.ive recently ordered this book for last min prep,i really got startled goin through it,itz not at all useful or cannot contribute for prep on competitive exams,once you buy i bet you will get annoyed..this might not be useful for last min prep but can be good for goin over."
"
 Good for minute preparation.
I brought this book from flipkart and it was shipped nicely within 
3 days.
For those who want all formulaes in one book or full compilation of formulae then go with this book.
It also explains some basics terms and defination. "
"This formula book was a disappointment for me as it does not cater the needs of todays competition requirements."
"this book is good to learn and revise the formula-es which can be used to solve the questions mostly asked in school level examinations but this book lacks some topics and points which are mostly required for competitive examinations...although this book mentions that it is useful for entrances but u can t get all.... at last.. u can use this to learn basic formulas if u don t like to study big big volumes and to revise at the last moment :)"
"This book does not come up to my expectation. Before I place the order, I thought this will be positively helpful but is not really.Although I am not disappointed, I even can say that this book is of mid level standard."
"THIS BOOK IS VERY INFORMATIVE. ONE CAN EASILY STUDY ALL FORMULAE S IN ONE GO. MUST HAVE PRODUCT FOR ENTRANCE EXAM ASPIRANTS."
"totaly bad book.it was a stupid book...................it does not contain any good and important information..............dont buy this book,,,,,,,,,,......................."
"Everyone solves Irodov s Problems in General Physics and it is very popular for the competitive exams. And this book teaches you how to solve them(only the mechanics portion though).
The book is really helpful if one is looking to build up and extend his concepts on mechanics. It covers basic Newtonian mechanics and relativistic mechanics as well.
The treatment is unique but might appear dry and technical at times but the examples are very lucid."
"
 If you are preparing for an entrance exam like SAT or JEE (Advance) and have already completed Irodov and HCV and all other sorts of books and papers.....and are looking for a book that provides you the toughest problems for the final revisions, then this book is for you.
Dont buy this if you are preparing for MAINS or any other exams. This contains 4 topics, namely mechanics, heat & molecular physics, optics and electromagnetism which are toughest topics in physics. The best part are the solutions. The numerical aspect is good, but the detailed imaginative way of answering has made this book a final and ultimate refer guide. If you solve all 200 questions of it, i can bet you will get through any physics olympiad or exam.
Cheers !!!!! "
"This is a wonderful book containing unique problem and having solution of these problems too. problems are very good and very difficult. understanding fine points of physics was not so easy earlier.................................................................................................................................................................................................................."
"
 the book does not contain any sort of interesting or useful stuff just much of out of track INSUFFICIENT details provided. not at all recommended just a waste of time......................
better not look forward to it guys......!!!!!! "
"
 i bought this book and dint found any impressive stuff,its a normal book and dont think to give it my precious tym........
author should review his work and give it some tym and make it a productive one so that it can benifit students,
overall i dont like it at all "
"
 if u feel that its for covering the topics or finding formulae than plz dont go with it. u will not find anything perferct, just definition and that are copied from the books which today a researcher or even student not follow.................................
think on it "
"The book is well designed and the question are tough up to a level,once you get through the whole book you will have a easy way through your competitive exams including Olympiads,JSTSE,and many more .The book has a easy language w easy concepts which will make you understand things better.I bought this book for the all India level quiz held at VMC THE SMART GENIE and i found it out easy to prepare because of this fabulous book.It has sample papers too included which provides you a grip for tough exams."
"This is a high level book 
It is an out of syllabus kind of a book
It may be difficult for some people to study it but the questions are the best you can have"
"the book covers all the topics of olympiads,nstse etc and other talent search exams.undoubtedly the best book for competitive exams.good shortcuts for multiplications are also present."
"a good book for CCE pattern and encouraging for iit foundation. Every students must go through this book. this is helpful to teachers also."
"I loved the packaging, the book arrived in perfect condition, was very happy to receive it in time. Book is excellent on the subject, would recommend it anybody serious over the subject study."
"
 Brilliant book by Ashis Sir 
Ample amount amount solved problems
Good Theory
Illustrations 
Practice Questions 
.............. 
Mechanics will be a cake walk if u you solve this book "
"the gs topic which is an out dated one.My suggestion is not to buy this book.the technical part is not having so worthfull content"
"if u r preparing for SAIL exam then u must purchase this book it will help u a lot and will provide u good guidance for how to prepare for SAIL paper"
"Good book for not only SAIL but also any other PSUs exam... but price of the book is higher than other online seller"
"it is a nice book for those who prepare for SAIL exam . It will help for student & can easily understand the answer ."
"Technical part is good covering all areas,some mistakes are there needed to be modified.aptitude & reasoning,english parts are very good.."
"Service was too good.. but some pages of book were folded inside which were of larger size than it should be... and so I was not happy with product... Flipkart should have look on product before they should deliver (** at least in such cases where no one will bother about whether product is sealed or not)"
"properly packaged and was sent in time, good quality of paper was maintained.. will look forward to shop with you again whenever i look for some material of this kind"
"this is a general book and does not any where get related to gate study or any competitive exam study please donot buy this"
"ONLY THE DEFINITION OF TERMS ARE GIVEN AND ALSO SOME BASICS FORMULA BUT THE TERMS ARE ARRANGED IN ALPHABETICAL MANNER AS IN DICTIONARY. 
( HAND BOOK SHOULD BE IN CHAPTER WISE AND CONTAINING ENTIRE TERMS & FORMULA.)"
"This book is too small, but still you can read it like a story book for primary school students. Things are just brief, just to brush up your memory. Size is just 8 X 5 , with 240+ pages, but don\ t expect much as the characters are large. Still you can have this. This will be the best use for people like me who have completed their degree and doing job, but still desperate to remember the things at least in periphery, they studied."
"this book doesn t rise up to expectations. i think better books are available with a slightly bigger price tag. the important problem is that the book lacks continuity which makes readers irritated."
"many definitions and meanings are given in good manner like arranging them in order. i found it very useful."
"
 first i thankful to flipkart that they deliver me the books within 3 days...
and books very nice no doubt and those who pass the Mechanical engg,good book for brush pa and quick revision.. "
"this hand book is great for a quick revision of all most all concepts definitions and formulas related to mechanical engineering and you are getting this book for only rs . 68 so just give it a shot and you won t regret it."
"the book is awessom and the service was quit good...overall i like the product and service... from Mechanical eng point of view..this book is nice.."
"it is a very nice book........................................ and useful to JAM stats....... WHO ARE WILLING to crack JAM can go through this book as a reference"
"
 This also has e few mistakes. the explanations are very compact and precise.
You can use it as a practice book. test papers were good. 
Always make sure they dont deliver you with old edition. "
"u Anand kumar is great matematician and very good book for iit jam aspirants. book contain complete solution. any doubt then you consult at www.anandinstitute.org. IIT s conduct JAM Entrance Examination jointly to select the students who can pursueM.Sc. Mathematics at the IIT s. To clear the examination one should have abilityto handle objective as well as subjective questions efficiently as the paper consist both typeof questions. It\xe2\x80\x99s syllabus consist of Mathematics up to graduation level. We provide scientific approach to handle the questions in order to get through the examination smoothly."
"U CAN EASILY COMPLETE 35 DAY Crash COURSE FROM
 THIS BOOKS IN JUST 5 DAYS MUST TRY IT ITS GOOD"
"I was losing motivation to work hard for JEE. Then I read this read and I became enthusiastic once again. This book can help to lift morale. It also contains some specific techniques which should be applied while studying for JEE."
"This book is good for mcq practice. However explanations are not in book which is major setback. MCQs helpful for understanding concepts."
"
 This is an excellent book with 360 NEET-PG questions. All the questions are very stimulating and I found myself enjoying while I was going through the book. The explanations are concise but sufficient to get the facts registered. But I would suggest readers to make small notes if they wish. 
After reading this book I feel much more confident and am hungry for more NEET pattern questions... "
"Its a good book for preparing before the exams. The questions are excellent but the explanations are a bit short. I would suggest the readers to have a reference book & go through the relevant text. Overall its a nice book for revising & to get a knowledge of where we stand."
"
 worst book eyerseen,ordered 10 days back and it is not shipped till now
...............idiots if u dont hv book in stock why u take order............morons "
"The book is good for the mechanical Engineering Students. They can learn many object type question from Objective Mechanical Engineering 12th Edition ...."
"
 I liked this book due to its simplicity and comprehensivenes in explaining the concepts necessary from ground up. All basics before starting the periodic table are provided in the book. I liked two aspects much 1) work book excersices here and there for all intermdiary of chapters and 2) practical application examples as i saw in most costly foreign author chemistry books.
I give 4 stars instead of 5 only due to the lack of advanced coverage still more. But those stuffs and advanced treatment may not be much available in indian autor books, but i saw some in JD Lee and Cottons Basic & Advanced Inorganic chemistry.
Overall it is a very excellent effort from author Dr. R K Gupta.
Alcohol meter (breathalyzer) application logic using K2Cr2O7 and ethanol is excellent as provided in example excercises.
For IIT, advanced engg. college entrances and AIIMS/advanced medical entrance aspirants will find this most useful. The autor gives priority in explaining to dull/average student in his entire book coverage than for most brilliant one.
But for chemistry lovers like me, i expect coordination chemistry still more advanced and in fact this topic is much sought after in IIT entrances. 
I promise anybody will love to read this book and the well graded excercises. "
"The book was labelled 2013 but the content inside the book was all of 2011 with thousands of printing mistakes. 
In fact at one of the places REPUBLIC DAY WAS WRITTEN TO BE ON 15th AUGUST.
Go for it if its cheap and fun for you."
"i bought this product,not from flipkart. 
This book has a lot of mistakes in it, After reading something you will be in a confusion that what you read is correct or wrong !
After buying this book u will have to purchase another one like Lucent s General Knowledge"
"
 Good book with excellent graded problems. Theory is straight forward as they mention. At least some very little basic chemistry understanding is needed for succesfully reading this book. Whatever the reason, i liked this book unconditionally. It should be useful compared to other books available in market. 
I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 so that author can remove errors in few worked out problems (e.g. a problem following very lengthy one in first chapter.) and i hope this point i mentioned doesnt under estimate the whole value of book. New author Ranjeet Shahi is my favourite author after i bought this one. Soon, i will buy Essentials of Organic chemistry by same author and give my feedback. "
"i bought this book. font size and shape of the contents are very much poor. the paper quality also very much poor. with in half-an-hour of reading, you will get irritation. you can t expect much quality from this book. 
this same publisher had published one good book for general knowledge, authored by tarun goyal. but i dont know why they have discontiued it from printing."
"Goood for people who fear from organic chemistry.......like me....Thanks arihant for making such wonderfull books....."
"It is a very informative book with all concepts mentioned appropriately, improves some of your necessary concepts and provides all the necessary guidance for preparation for iitjee. One of the best books for organic in market."
"
 This review comes from a serious Mba aspirant.A book with 600 pages of information in the form of over 6000 questions (avg 70-80 qns) on the all the topics mentioned. 
Salient features: 
*Questions arranged-subject wise and chapter-wise.
*Collection of IAS,PCS,NDA,CDS,SSC etc qns up to 2012.

"A REALLY AMAZING BOOK SIMPLY LOVED SOLVING THE CHALLENGING PROBLEMS THE THEORY HAS BEEN WELL EXPLAINED WITH GR8 ILLUSTRATIONS TRULY WORTHY IIT JEE BOOK COMPETITION TO HC VERMA S CONCEPTS OF PHYSICS THE ONLY THING THAT SUCKS IS THE PINK COVER 
GOT THE BOOK IN JUST 3 DAYS MY SPECIAL THNX TO THE FLIPKART TEAM"
"It s one of those books that are difficult to describe or rate. Rather a paradox. On the question side fair, but on the solution side, niggardly. Can t settle on the question of the audience: who is it for? - the IIT aspirants or the IITians. Except for level two questions no solutions or even hints are available. So unless there s a strong guide to fall back upon, the book can be quite exasperating. I d rather the author had gone for a few more pages even at the risk of increasing the price a bit, say another twenty five of forty five rupees."
"Mechanics part 1 by DC pandey is out of the world.It is perfect for competitive exams especially for IIT jee and AIEEE.The concepts are crisply explained and the special cases of many concepts are there as well.However,the solutions aren t aren t there barring one or 2 exercises.Still,buy it and you won t regret.This and HCV are enough for IIT prep"
"I am a XIth standard student and I aspire to clear IITJEE and AIEEE. I came to know that DC PANDEY is a very good author of COMPETITIVE EXAMS Books. So I bought this book. I was not clear about a lot of topics and now I am now 99% confident about the chapters I read.This also has a lot of questions. And also seperate parts, AIEEE corner and IITJEE corner. Although I found some flaws that some topics are not even touched(i dont mean that anything from the IITJEE syllabus but some topics that are needed to understand those) otherwise I think this is a very good book and I will buy the other parts also. :-)"
"Concept is simplified and easily understandable...examples and problems in the exercises are enough to score top in your competitions !!"
"This book contains good problems with conceptual exercises . Every chapter starts from the basics , then the solved problems give an exact insight of the competetive exams ,the AIEEE corner is quite easy . The book categorizes concepts and the best problems come at the last (it s the same for all the book s) .
The only drawback is that the tough problems are not given solutions"
"This is the best ever book of Physics i ever bought.it has sufficient no. of questions in each nd evry topic.i WOULR SAY evryone shld try this book once......................................................................................................................................."
"this book has no matching . even those who don t like physics will love reading this book and solving numerical. one must buy this book preparing for any competitive examination as well as for school exam. tremendous book. a special thanks to flip kart.com ."
"Its an awesome book to clear your mechanics basics and to increase your intellectual on mechanics.Each topic covered with simple language,solved examples and exercises to make the reader s knowledge on mechanics more wide.A must have book for JEE and AIEE aspirants."
"This book is very well written and explains all the concepts properly.Great work done by the author to help the students prepare for the entrance exams.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand mechanics in depth.Even a tough topic like rotational mechanics is dealt with brilliantly and gives the student confidence to perform in the exam."
"this is a very good book that has been very useful for my IIT preparation . even my teachers recommend the solving of this book on a day to day basis. the book courses saliently through the most important topics in physics: rotational and fluid mechanics. a good way to be confident of an IIT rank is by solving atleast 5 sums from each of the AIEEE and IIT corners of each books.it is a must have book for every IIT aspirant!!"
"Physics is easily understandable and you can score top in iit advanced if you eat,swallow the book for 1000 times !!"
"The only book that is better than HC Verma to clear your concepts as well as provide you with a huge variety of questions in Mechanics,specifically suited for IIT JEE aspirants. Rotational Mechanics, SHM, gravitation and Fluids chapters are covered in an awesome manner.must have!"
"Guys to be true.Look This books problems are good but solutions are not upto the mark. The book has a wide assortment of problems but when u solve them and u see the answers are not matching but your answer is dimensionally correct then that is a printing mistakes. And you won t be satisfied with just one , you will get many. So don t look at the answers and solutions at the back. just don t get irritated. Its better you solve hc verma and your school text book and then attempt this book on any chapter. Nevertheless a good book !"
"This book is an excellent one for all those students preparing for Engineering Entrances Like JEE, or their state joints. This is a must have book in electricity and magnetism and I suggest students must have the entire series of DC Pandey. Large question bank of questions of all levels and standards, crystal clear text material and a large number of shortcuts help prepare for the time-limited exams like JEE. Buy this and enjoy. Cheers!"
"Electricity and magnetism is very much simplified..you feel like you are awesome at these topics while reading this book !!"
"
 It is a good book and very useful for tjose want to pursue JEE seriosly.I recommend you to buy this book in the first year itself rather wait for the second year and start solving it because electricity and magnetism make a bulk of questions in jee. 
Also i got the older version of the book.Please dont repeat this mistake in the future Flipkart :( "
"the books just clear any concept in an easy and simple way . it is the book that you must buy if you want to clear your entrance test this book is also good for doing differnt types of numericals and objectives at different levels"
"
 the book is very creative and nice,but if u guys are are already appearing for ISEET then much of the extra syllabus has been given 
as the latest syllabus has been changed for this upcoming new entrance exam.Also very thankful for the fastest delivery of lovable flipkart. "
"
 i liked this book quite much....
but this book is only good for IIT MAINS examination point of view.....for the IIT advanced purpose have h c verma or halliday walker/krane...best of luck for ur examzz fellas.... also this buk could be used as a hots questions bank for cbse exams......... "
"ONE OF THE HUGE SIXERS BY D.C.PANDEY.
THIS 4TH BOOK OF IITJEE SERIES DELIVERS ITS PROMISE AND CONTAINS WELL DESCRIBED TOPICS AS WELL AS HUGE DATABASE OF QUESTIONS FOR ALL TYPES OF STUDENTS...AND THE BOOK ALSO CONTAINS OBJECTIVE AS WELL AS SUBJECTIVE SO IT WORKS AS DOUBLE BOOSTER BOTH FOR ENTRANCE AND ISC\CBSE\STATE BOARDS"
"A great buy for anyone wanting to be best in physics.
This book has a whole lot of information. Though the presentation is not too well but if u have read it once or twice your sure to find everything in it.
Actually it contains information which is somewhat misplaced but it s surely there.
The Extra features at the end of each chapter are very useful. All the important results & tips & trick are given in that section.
Optics & Modern Physics both have indeed some mind boggling questions."
"Like any other DC PANDEY series book....this book is brilliantly written,contains best problem collections. One should solve all problems of this book...but before books like HC VERMA sholud be solved...those who don t want 5 different semi complete books for JEE should go for Krishnas IIT Physics..as it starts with the most basic level. Arihant books should be solved by coaching/tuition/etc students.Overall MUST BUY! It is a good topic to score in JEE/AIEEE/JEE mains....and SLEE"
"
 well, this book dealt with every basic concept of physics and will help in understanding the different types of problems deal in this subject 
Hope it will help u all also 
never forget to solve different solved example from question of last 10 years while understanding fhe topics. This will Help you alot. 
Best of Luck "
"Guys to be true.Look This books problems are good but solutions are not upto the mark.

Its better you solve hc verma and your school text book and then attempt this book on any chapter. Nevertheless a good book !"
"Arihant has done its magic once again... This buk is clearly awesome... All Physics lovers shud try solving Irodov alongside this solution book (provided they are very clear with the basic concepts) For the basics, I d prefer HC Verma or Resnick Halliday Walker... After being thorough with the basics, this buk really comes in handy... 
The one key feature of this buk above all others is that after each question, they have given other qns of the same kind so that we can make sure that we understood that concept... Highly Useful for JEE Advanced..."
"solution with similar problems for solving are also given along with it so u can check your level of understanding.won t say its a must buy for iit but it will definitely help you solving i.e irodov and getting a foundation in physics problem soving"
"a good book for iit jee preparation,and also the best if you are self studying.though it contains some errors but still it is a nice book"
"
 a good book, great theory and a lot of questions, best for self studies, a little error though but other than that its good..
great price on flipkart and fast delivery too.. :) "
"This book is very helpful for those who are preparing for ISI(Indian Statistical Institute) and IIT-JEE and all other national entrance exams... It has good theories and many solved examples... But though there nis some errors in it yet it is very helpful... A living teacher I say... So friends buy it if you really want to learn mathematics and not only doing it... Best of luck for you all :)"
"this book is very helpful for IIT aspirants..It has a good collection of solved problems and exercises. It has sums over a wide range of levels best suited for the students. The hints for the exercises help a lot."
"Trust me frndz dis book is a worst one for students preparing for JEE.Without giving any concepts and only giving harder problem as solved example this try to vanish our minds......this book made u accustomed to only dat problems those were given in solved example and if question comes from out of book wo cant even tackle it, so only those who are over brilliant they may buy dis but for an avg guy this book is worst case scenario...."
"the concepts have been given clearly ,..........
the book has nice no. of questions but they are not good enough for the level of preperation needed for JEE.................
the price offered by flipkart is excellent and the delivery was alright ,..........."
"The book is great for clearing concepts....several in-text problems consolidate the learning through problems technique...all the methods discussed in great detail in the book....buy this and you will require no other book for differential calculus. All the best!"
"A good book for all those who do self study and dont want to pay high amount of money to coaching classes. It gives a variety of methods of solving problems and some short-cuts for answering the questions easily and quickly. It give numerous amount of unsolved and solved questions that helps you in getting acquainted with the pattern of questions asked and improve your ability to solve questions. Seriously buy this book and enjoy your journey with simple form of CALCULUS. 
P.S. It requires basics concepts of set theory and functions and also the meaning and understanding of differentiation.."
"THE BOOK IS GREAT. GOOD THEORY WITH SUFFICIENT EXAMPLES . GOOD QUALITY OF QUESTIONS. SOLUTONS ARE ALSO PROVIDED . EASY TO USE AND ONE CAN UNDERSTAND IT EASILY. U CAN ALSO PREFER BUYING CENGAGE BOOKS. BASIC INEQUALITY CHAOTER IS EXPLAINED IN DETAIL"
"Awesome book!!!!!!!!contains all types of sums.....helps to build a deep concept on differential calculus!!!!!with this book on can excel in this topic. also try the intergral calculus-by amit m agarwal!!!."
"
 d buk explains each nd every step in detail.....gives quite a number of solved examples...as well as exercise problems....even a 
beginner can learn from d simple way of explainin done in d buk....best 4 preparations 4 iit "
"great book, go for it blindly if u are preparing for iit jee.excellent problems.great coverage of all topics as well. if you can complete this book,you will feel much more confident and prepared for any exam"
"apt book for JEE prep , as it covers a wide variety of solved & unsolved questions also it has all types of questions (mcq)
 can be used as a textbook for the way the concepts are explained."
"the name arihant attached itself implies that the book was of good quality, but i was worried whether it would serve my purpose for competitive exams in india,as they lay a great emphasis on maths...i got the book and although i dont every part of it,i have realised that maths could be done in alternate ways in very swift and fast methods with using graphs...i like the book"
"this is a very useful book as it will help u to solve the various kinds of problems in an unconventional and tricky manner.it helps a student to increase his mental ability to face a problem as it increases our concepts hugely..hats off to amit agarwal.."
"I BOUGHT THIS BOOK AND I FOUND THAT THE BOOK WAS THE BEST IN ITS CATEGORYAND ONE WHICH IS A GOOD WAY O INTRODUCING THE CONCEPT OF GRAPHS AND HOW TO SOLVE PROBLEMS OF JEE MAINS AND ADVANCED. HATS OF TO AMIT M AGARWAL AND ARIHANT"
"This is a great book for students who are preparing for forth coming jee exam and for other competitive exams.This book will make you realize that there is always a smarter way to solve problems using graphs.It has got very useful information inside with plenty of shortcuts.So it s worth buying.Good luck."
"It is a really good book to study coordinate geometry from. 
Pros:
Really good theory 
Examples and theorems are done usually by more than one method
If u sit down, try to prove theorems yourself,do the examples your concept will be concrete 
there is a little more than in IIT syllabus but no complaints as it is just dealing with various types of problems like line mirror(based on application of concepts in syllabus) that can definetley come for exams. 
Cons 
not too many practice problems. For that you need ML Khanna"
"ALL IIT-JEE STUDENTS,MUST USE THIS BOOK, IT IS A MASTERPIECE AND NO.OF SOLVED PROBLEMS BEING HUGE, GIVES GR8 INSIGHT INTO THE SUBJECT AND ONE CAN ACCUMULATE TRICKS FROM THESE, AUTHOR SOLVED PREVIOUS YEAR JEE QUESNS SO THAT STUDENTS FEEL THAT THE EXAM IS EASY WHICH IS A +VE APPROACH,I CAN GUARANTEE EVRY1 CAN LEARN FROM IT,I MEAN ANY 1 EVEN THE WEAKEST IN MATHS , BEST OF LUCK 2 EVERYBODY"
"
 WELL I SIMPLY DIDNT LIKE THE BOOK THE NO. OF SOLVED EXAMPLES R MUCH MORE THAN THE NUMBER OF PROBLEMS 
THE AUTHOR HAS FOCUSED MORE ON PROBLEMS WHICH ALREADY CAME IN IIT JEE RATHER THAN CREATING HIS OWN PROBLEMS THERE R A FEW ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS WHICH R NOT SO GUD(THOUGH CHALLENGING I MUST SAY) THE AUTHOR HAS NOT WRITTEN THIS BOOK IN A VERY SYSTEMATIC WAY "
"With the formulae being definitely above the mark and a variety of questions being included this book definitely packs a punch.........will definitely recommend it to people to get their concepts cleared before attempting iit-level questions........A PRODUCT WORTH FIVE STARS!!!!"
"
 The Perfect Book for AIEEE coaching. Explains all necessary concepts properly and possesses a very good set of questions which are explained comprehendibly. The content is most appropriate for AIEEE level of training and i recommend you to buy this book.
There is also a well defined periodic table attached inside which i ripped and stuck it on my wall.

 The Perfect Book for AIEEE coaching. Explains all necessary concepts properly and possesses a very good set of questions which are explained comprehendibly. The content is most appropriate for AIEEE level of training and i recommend you to buy this book.
There is also a well defined periodic table attached inside which i ripped and stuck it on my wall.

"New Pattern AIEEE Chemistry This is a book required for students preparing for aieee evenIIT. All the concepts are given clearly and th students will not feel lengthy to study this book.
LESS VOLUME MORE CONCEPTS. If you study this book thoroughly then nbo need to buy other books. 
very poor delivery"
"
 This is very good book those who want crack iit , flipcart service was awesome and just came 2 days , thanks for the 40% discount .
the book contains all the iit sums of physics till date with very good solutions "
"
 This is a wonderful book for those preparing for the IITJEE examinations.. It has a easy to read interface, and original concise and correct solutions to the questions of last 33 years.
All types of questions ranging from MCQ, multi correct, matrix match, linked comprehension, assertion reason, numericals are clearly given.. Solutions have been shown by more than one methods.. Self analysis and review qestions are also given. Marks division from chapters on the iit papers are also given. "
"Any iit aspirant can buy this book for previous years iit jee papers. This book contains all the previous years iit questions chapterwise. Even it contains synopsys which is very useful to revise.Even we get good discounts from flipkart and also delivery id also very fast."
"excellent delivery...delivered in 18 hours!!!!!!!
gr8 book to study from ...helped me to understand the pattern of IITJEE physics. Has surely helped me a lot. Moreover chapter crux points helps in very quick revision of each and every chapter"
"If you have not practiced question of any chapter just read the crux points then try that chapter from this book you will definitely gain confidence in that chapter........................................................."
"The book is well organised with questions sorted out according to chapter. Solutions are easy to understand. Must buy for all students appearing for IIT - JEE."
"This book and other in this series(maths,chem)are just waste of your money.This book contains only 50-65%(approx)of the previous years jee questions and you are devoid of many good questions.Those who recommend this book are in illusion.If you don t believe compare it with the MTG book.
So better go for the MTG publication at least in this case"
"This book is just too good , and has a precise collection of the past year JEE questions , proves very handy during the entire course of preparation . i would suggest the readers to buy this book as early as possible n start solving it. It also has mock test on each chapter so that students can strengthen their grip . Great book to buy !!"
"
 even though it is void of many jee questions still it is bestas alll books dont have all ques . hence i recommended this book . even it contains basic theory and formula in the beginning
In short you can buy this "
"Delivery was fast as usual from flipkart. Book in great condition. Well organised and solutions are precise and easy to understand. I would recommend it to any student appearing for the IIT - JEE."
"
 various questions of jee were missing . hence we are not getting benifit completely .
 its quite good that formula are provided as overview. delivery was quite good delivered in 2 days. in short good book "
"
 The problem is not that some questions are missing , the main problem is that solutions are not good
they are too long and an average student can not understand it.
But the book is very useful for real aspirants. "
"The best book with best solutions in the market . Problem solving strategy is just amazing .Delivery was fast as usual from flipkart Delivered in 36 hours. In addition to this there s 31% discount and nowhere else."
"students preparing AIEEE should have it. Question are solved with very good detail. Surely it will help students to sharpen their knowledge.The book also divided into subject wise which makes life easier to switch from one subject to another."
"
 This Book Is A Must For All AIEEE and Other Entrance Exam Aspirants and I Must Say That It Contains 10 Mock Test Which Are very Helpful.
Must Buy If You Want To Get AIEEE Papers Nothing It Better Than This One "
"
 The solutions are correct for all the questions i checked but noticed some other problems. 
1.Solutions of 10 questions (chemisty- 2010 q10-20) are missing. 
2.A few answer keys are wrong but their solutions are correct. 
Also 2010 paper was in between the two 2011 papers which kind of give me a headache. 
I just got the book yesterday . All i can say that is that its worth it. "
"
 this book includes all previous papers(2002-2011) and very very yseful. i used only this one in the last ten days of my aieee prep. vefore any exam, be it iit or aieee do not do anything else except solving previous papers and mock tests. this book fulfills all needs- past aieee papers and mock tests that match the present pattern of aieee. 
i could find some issues with one or two answers almost in every alternate answer key but yet this the most accurate any other book has been!!!!! "
"The mock test are based on previous years pattern and havn t been updated and it I DO NOT recommend it. Now the question paper has 30 question but the mock test aren t so.
But the service of flipkart was good(as always). Thums up..!!"
"
 This combined phy-chem-maths 10 yrs AIEEE questions book from Arihant is not free of errors. It would have been more helpful if the questions were Chapter-Wise and NOT Year-Wise. 
The subject-wise 10 years AIEEE questions from Arihant have the question sorted-by chapters which proves to be more helpful. "
"The book was labelled 2013 but the content inside the book was all of 2011 with thousands of printing mistakes. 
In fact at one of the places REPUBLIC DAY WAS WRITTEN TO BE ON 15th AUGUST.
Go for it if its cheap and fun for you."
"i bought this product,not from flipkart. 
This book has a lot of mistakes in it, After reading something you will be in a confusion that what you read is correct or wrong !
After buying this book u will have to purchase another one like Lucent s General Knowledge"
"
 Good book with excellent graded problems. Theory is straight forward as they mention. At least some very little basic chemistry understanding is needed for succesfully reading this book. Whatever the reason, i liked this book unconditionally. It should be useful compared to other books available in market. 
I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 so that author can remove errors in few worked out problems (e.g. a problem following very lengthy one in first chapter.) and i hope this point i mentioned doesnt under estimate the whole value of book. New author Ranjeet Shahi is my favourite author after i bought this one. Soon, i will buy Essentials of Organic chemistry by same author and give my feedback. "
"i bought this book. font size and shape of the contents are very much poor. the paper quality also very much poor. with in half-an-hour of reading, you will get irritation. you can t expect much quality from this book. 
this same publisher had published one good book for general knowledge, authored by tarun goyal. but i dont know why they have discontiued it from printing."
"Goood for people who fear from organic chemistry.......like me....Thanks arihant for making such wonderfull books....."
"It is a very informative book with all concepts mentioned appropriately, improves some of your necessary concepts and provides all the necessary guidance for preparation for iitjee. One of the best books for organic in market."
"
 This review comes from a serious Mba aspirant.A book with 600 pages of information in the form of over 6000 questions (avg 70-80 qns) on the all the topics mentioned. 
Salient features: 
*Questions arranged-subject wise and chapter-wise.
*Collection of IAS,PCS,NDA,CDS,SSC etc qns up to 2012.
*Almost all accurate ans. 
Really loved it. Latest edition and wonderful print quality.
just go for it!! "
"This is a very good book in organic chemistry it has helped me a lot in understanding the subject in the simplest possible way. a lot of solved examples are given which is great in understanding and a variety of practice problems have also been given which makes it one of the best book in organic chemistry
GO FOR THIS ONE, IT LL HELP YOU A LOT."

BEST BOOK FOR ORGANIC CHEMISTRY "
"I have bought this book from flipkart. It is a very good book, specially for those who are preparing for SSC exams. Small book but contains sufficient amount of knowledge of most of the topics. also the font size of the contents are also good and readable, will make reader interested."
"Its an AWESOME Book. It contains all the types of questions that are asked these days with detailed solutions to all of them. It is actually a perfect blend of questions of IIT-JEE, AIEEE, BITSAT and various other State Level Engineering Entrance Examinations. Go for it Blindly!"
"
 This is exatly the kind of book i was looking for.. 
Sufficient questions for practice wich covers all the concepts and is based on new pattern..
The solution provided are also short and clear..
If one is looking for a book just for practice then this is the best.. "
"had only problems, no theory. Good for problems but not what I was looking for. Should have mentioned it.Would have preferred it if FlipKart has a sneak peek preview of the book so thay we can see what it looks like on the inside too."
"
 This book is awesome!! I highly recommend it to all the IIT aspirants in the country. The book is updated to the new pattern of JEE and covers every type of problem in full detail!
Going through this book completely and solving every problem will definitely give you a good edge over others. Blindly go for it! 
And as usual, Flipkart is amazing! I ordered the book last night at around 10:00 p.m. and received it today at 4:00 p.m. !! I was literally shocked! Keep up the good work Flipkart! "
"
 this book is very useful for those who are interested to crack IIT and AIEEE...it contains a lot variety of questions and a huge no of questions...
it has variety questions with satisfactory and time saving solutions. "
"the separate editions of S.K GOYAL books were far far better.. This book is absolutely nothing as compared to them.. AS an iitian , i would not recommend any aspirants to buy this book & instead focus on its sep. editions .. the questions r absolutely of low level with poor explanations .."
"The book no doubt is good but all that book contains is mere 2 question papers and their answer explanations! With publication year mentioned as 2005 and noted 1st edition, it wasn t that big a heartbreak but the description makes it look like a collection of papers from 2005 onwards . So, please make up your mind before purchasing it as its a 200 page old and detailed guide to COMED-K. I regret this purchase as the I missed the finer prints so I suggest you be judicious!"
"this book has Numbers of and numbers of types question in all types.one correct,more than one,matrix match,assertion-reason and comprehension based question.more than 8000 question. BUT VERY VERY FEW QUESTION ARE SOLVED IT IS IT\ S (-) POINT."
"Hats off to flipkart for delivery before the stipulated time, yet again they have proved that how awesome they are! Talking about the book, the number and types of questions that are in this book are unbeatable. However solutions to VERY few have been provided probably they were trying to reduce its volume. Apart from it, its a complete book."
"this book has only questions (all types)
this book has zero concepts.
so if you want a books for concepts this is not the book for you.
but for questions this is probably the best book in the market"
"
 This is a book required for students preparing for IIT. All the concepts are given clearly and th students will not feel lengthy to study this book.
 LESS VOLUME MORE CONCEPTS. If you study this book thoroughly then nbo need to buy other books. "
"Book based on general knowledge and out of syllabus facts,,even physical chemistry has factual questions,and numericals are quite easy ,book might be useful for jee main candidates,but there are more better books than it regarding the same,,this book is not at all ideal for IIT aspirants"
"This book is awesome.This book is awesome to practice roblems.Once u got the concept then start solving problems from this book and u will find ur concepts strengthened.By reading this book u will get very minute concepts clear which are usually not given attention by the students.SO Start solving problems of this book.But one thing to note in this book is that solutions to the problems are not provided.So it is its con."
"
 questions are good but solutions are not provided to all
book is also heavy
hence overall i will give it 3 stars
i am myself in dire need of a good chemistry book but this book is not the book i was looking for "
"No explanation given . Useful only when u know some higher topics . Otherwise it s great for grade 8
But don t buy this book if you are struggling with the normal syllabus"
"I recommend this book for improving your learning skill who want to learn more.Book is systematically indexed.I personally loved it.Pages are intact."
"
 i think this book is a bit advanced for students who are not going for iitjee coaching classes but it gives a great deal of explanations . 
i think it was useful for students like me. "
"IIT Foundation Explorer - Physics -Solutions - 9 by BMA is a nice book and looking this we had ordered today IIT Foundation Explorer - Chemistry - 9 book. 
It will more nice if solution of both book can be also arrange with free delivery option.
Thank you and have nice wonderful day.
Regards/
Jayant."
"
 I have graduated from mechanical engineer(been 2 years)and wanted to keep in touch with the subjects as I have lost the touch. 
This book helps me to keep in touch with the my core subjects.I have gone through a few topics and it is really simple to go through and topics are thoroughly covered. "
"
 This is very small book. Has some mistakes.. Most material is copied from other books... they copied the mistakes as well...
very use full for people to want to know things fast........................................................................................ "
"This Mathematics book is the best mathematical guide I ever met. It contains everything in its best and concise way. I purchased it 1 month before JEE Advanced and it seriously shook my confidence about mathematics. It has very diverse questions and could be said quite hard also. This book can be used not only for JEE but to clear the basic mathematics also. A Highly recommended piece for those who don t go to coachings."
"
 This book is fantastic!
author has outdone itself and has provided the perfect book for preparations!
could have included more qs. "
"A really good book for IIT JEE advanced (and even mains) maths...contains lots of very good problems. a must buy book for every jee aspirant"
"
 Pros:
1) Theory is very comprehensive and states out some unique points.
2) It has got very good problems for discussion
3) Important Tips and Ideas are a chief spotlight of this book. This section provides with useful tips and lists out some cautions and misconceptions useful for a student.
Cons:
1) The number of problems is very less.
2) Not very good for a beginner.
3) Theory does not have a wide coverage,i.e., it misses out some portions in theory which are vital for current trends of JEE
Overall: A nice and different book which can bought for reference but should not be used as a base book. "
"Hats off to the Authors for having written such a wonderful book.Its extremely rare of Indian authors to write a mathematics book of such high standards.Problems are beautifully chosen and figures are drawn to perfection.I only wish the authors to write a supplement to this book which would contain rigorous proofs to some of the stated Facts and Theorems in the book."
"Brilliantly written book...should be followed by all iit aspirants. Some chapters have been discussed in a very unique way. best part is a large number of very good problems and solution for each problem is provided in the book only."
"This book is one of the best things to have happened to JEE aspirants in India . Just buy it if you are a serious aspirant and you will never regret it . The problems selected for discussion are really good but the solutions are even better helping the student to imbibe the right approach to attack a problem ."
"
 Nice book.
Level of questions is good.
Theory is very helpful for those who are not going through syudy centers... 
An allrounder for mathematics "
"I ve gone through the book. Synopsis is nicely given, points are not elaborated. It s useful only for quick revision. Only few solved examples are given. A lot of problems are left to reader, students should never buy such stupid book. Overall it s worst book for preperation. Don t really know where did the author put his 20 years teaching experience."
"
 pearson books are best
my experience says that they will get them well placed in Jee mains . i love this book. "
"
 Excellent book 
compact, informative, contains lots of tricks for solving problems,and huge number of questions with solved answers A good choice for those preparing for JEE
Flipkart service was as always excellent "
"this is a superb books for jee mains...with chapter wise descriptions along with solved and unsolved questions."
"oh my god what an extraordinary book in optics.believe me doing this book completely will make you fell that you are done with it.optics is a chapter in which student feels comfortable if he/she fills all the gaps in the formulas and sign convention which this book gives in a simplest manner.go for it serious iit aspirants"
"So, i used this book to prepare for the Indraprastha Uni MCA entrance .... but the paper quality is so bad that it is torturous to read from the book... 
Not to forget that it is replete with mistakes ..... I eventually ended up dumping this book and preparing from another book , made by another publisher.. 
Look around ... there are better options now... 
All the best"
"
 I used this book. It has a good collection of solved previous papers.
It will give you a good idea about the difficulty level of the paper.Which topics are regular, which are given more weight-age.
how to tackle high difficulty questions with shortcuts for MCQs. 
only defect is that the practice papers had a few out of current syllabus questions which you can ignore. 
I am a qualified candidate of JAM 2012 Mathematics.
best of luck to you! "
"There are a few mistakes but still enough to make you fee whats going to turn up in question paper. Don t rely solely on this book . Please make sure you buy the latest edition. I suggest go for the book by Anand Kumar"
"Flipkart facility is astonishingly good. But the book is very very poor quality.Some problems are missing from question paper and instead solved another question which is not set in the exam. Some answer are conceptually wrong and misleading.I do not recommend this book for young physicist."
"The Solutions look like some ancient Egyptian religious text. You see the solution, doesn t make sense, so you keep solving and think that it will make sense eventually. It never does. 
The solutions are mostly one-liners with symbols whose meanings are not explained."
"The book contains solved question papers of IIT JAM Physics till 2012. However most of the the solutions provided are brief. In many cases only hints for solution are provided. even then it is quite a useful book for an IIT aspirant."
"
 I ordered this book for my sister who is IIT M.Sc aspirant. This book is collection of previous year JAM question papers and also some model sets. As an ex-IIT student I can surely tell that there will be no repeating in JAM paper but solving previous year papers make oneself more potent to solve same pattern of questions in the actual JAM exam. 
Great delivery system from Flipkart as always. I recommend this book. "
"This is one of the useful book for IIT - JAM Admission Test (although I am not saying that it is the best book but recommended for aspirant). This book helps to understand that what will be the question pattern and provide exercise material for preparation."
"
 its good.but,,, questions are not nicely explained it may (65%) help some of uh .....
uh have to think yourself , because he (author) has skipped very steps.and he is pretending us phd students "
"I mainly bought this book to have the solved paper of 2012 JAM physics paper. But it doesn t contain the last year question paper. There is up to 2011. Secondly, there is not the explanations of all the questions, only some selected questions answers are there."
"gives you outline about exam structure and full of questions, dont expect the answers to be right everytime"
"
 there is no other such book available to guide u about this exam...
this is the best deal @ 154/-
go fo it...
subjective and objective both r there...(technical)
it will give u a better overview of this exam "
"It s nice book for electronics and communication s student for preparation of isro entrance exams. 
It contains all basics of electronics with good explanations.

"I found this book quiet helpful to understand modern javascripting coding style. 
Last javascript book I read was HTML, DHTML, JavaScript and perl by Ivan Bayross almost 10 years ago and since then a lot of things have been changing. 
This book helps you to brush-up your javascript skills if you haven t read javascript books since long."
"If you want yourself quickly get acquainted with the best practices & know-how of using different patterns around JavaScript, this is the book for you. It assumes certain level of familiarity with JavaScript and goes on exploring fine art of coding with JavaScript. Highly recommended if you want to unleash the power of JavaScript."
"
 Book resembles Javascript the Good Parts by Douglas Crockford at several places which is again by Yahoo Press.Its better to have either of these. 
Apart from that the book is very comprehensive in covering all scenarios of patterns that can be applied using Javascript as a programming language. 
Book covers extensive use cases if imbibed results in clean coding practice. "
"Avoid buying any of this author s books. I am one disgruntled student who ended up purchasing his Internet Marketing by Prof Mukesh Bhatia . 
The book is nothing but a concoction of all material which is plagiarised (directly copied over) from the internet, websites like wikipedia and the likes, with not even the courtesy of quoting them. Word to word material copy pasted and presented as his own. The self proclaimed MBA who has tought 50,000 plus students as per his introduction, is nothing but a fake."
"Hats off to sakshi mam for this amazing book. Guys don t wait just go for this book. This is simple handy concise and most important covers latest topics in obg. ..... And every word is a McQ and the presentation of case discussions is fabulous. I want such book for all major subjects but alas..... As the oter pre neet series is just not very good esp pediatrics and surgery.. ..... 
This is one stop shop for latest in obg"
"This book is really useful for neet ug if studied thoroughly. You can fully depend on it for inorganic chemistry. The theory information in chapter at glance is given in understandable language and many objective questions are given for practice at the end of each chapter. Its really a nice book for inorganic chemistry.Recommended for neet ug"
"Buy these books separately. these books are best books for any engineering aspirant. buy them individually, you will get in much lesser price. I have gone through these books & found them really useful, written in lucid & easy style.........."
"
 These books are just incredible. They contain all the concepts and they are explained very well too. Moreover the book contains a lots and lots of question to solve and gives a good practice too.
These contain questions varying from the basics to high level, which is a plus point. Moreover the way the author has explained is remarkable. "
"Awesome book with all the concepts explained in details..Moreover,it has numerous questions which enhance our brains to think critically..A must book to buy. All the important topics of IIT-JEE as well as for the boards have been written in this book so that the student doesn t find any difficulty while reading it."
"the sample papers are of pretty good standard. the explanations and answers given after every paper are good. also, the accompanying cd containing the papers in online format is great. all in all, from this book, a person would certainly have pretty much clear idea about the type and standard of question due to be appearing in the new format of the exam."
"
 Physics is very good(perfect jee-main level))
chemistry - good-but tougher than normal aieee level....
maths- totally out of track,,,no link with jee main!!!
however, one can buy and practice it.......
it will help you to prepare for worst situation.....
BEST OF LUCK! "
"This book contains questions of jee-advance maths and is not ideal to buy for maths papers. Physics and chemistry papers are good .... Upto the jee-main level but maths papers are a con side of this book"
"
 This book is just too good as it helps us to get real like test papers , a little higher than mains level.
Comes with a handy CD too !!
This book can be termed as to be a very good book , and can help you taste success in JEE Mains, well done !! "
"awesome book........................................!!!! Standard of questions is really good for jee-main...........Buy it now folks..............Complete paisa vasoooool.............................................. :)"
"Very helpful JEE resource.Every paper is of Jee standard. One can easily crack JEE with the help of these papers. The solutions are to the point and precise. Very much satisfying."
"I m a student of 12th, who s going to give the exam JEE main for the first time. 
I was confused to which book should I go throw... 
My search end up with this book. 
This book has more reviews, than any other book which is present on Flipkart. 
I hope this book will help me to score best in the exam."
"This book is basically prepared on the pattern of JEE MAIN. Practice papers questions are of good level. Nice and helpfull book."
"i am very thankful to arihant.. and authors for writing this book it gives us a perfect idea and practice for Jee Mains with this u get a CD but it has the same q papers as that of book but in online format u will feel very confident after having tested urself with this book."
"
 -Is nowhere near the standard of questions asked in Mains/AIEEE exam
-Questions are out of syllabus.
-Proved useless to me in all respects; I simply dumped the book
..................................................................................................................................... "
"for all the students in 12th and specially in gujarat who have very less time for JEE MAINS because of semester system goin on in Gujarat...must purchase this set for crash course ...you can complete all the three books in just 12 days...if u give enough time to it... ALL THE BEST to all :)"
" 
It has been conceived by keeping in mind the latest trend of questions, and the level of different types of students. Each book covers the complete syllabus of JEE Main in 40 Days; divided into day-wise-learning modules with clear grounding into concepts and sufficient practice with solved and unsolved questions on that day. Also, on last 3 days you get three full length Mock Tests in all 3 books that makes you ready to face the test. Its coherent presentation and compatibility with the latest prescribed syllabus and pattern will prove extremely useful for the students.
 Concepts discussed clearly and directly without being superfluous.
very nice set of books.scheduled to save students time..... :) "
"very nice set of books.scheduled to save students time.reliable and worthy.the books comprise of the total syllabus divided in to 30 topics for 30 days and 10 tests to test your efficiency .JEE MAIN aspirants should buy these books for sure."
"Fine service from flipkart. These books contains the syllabus in lucid. Highly recommended for self-study"
"
 excellent book good for reference.mainly for students who are preparing for jee examination.
delivery was before time. good condition of the package. "
"This is the first product I bought from Flipkart , their service is simply amazing. 
This is the only book I read during the last days before my JEE main exam and I can guarantee you that this book provides you all the knowledge that you need to have to crack JEE main exam. It has all the important stuff from the NCERT textbook and all the formulaes that you would need ,but some of the questions in the daily drills section are of little higher level than JEE main , so i would recommend you to give more priority to the entrance questions . Though I am awaiting my result but I know that this book helped me a lot to achieve a better rank"
"This is really a good book for JEE mains entrance as well as for school, as it consist all the important topics and concepts explained well in breif. Also the Flipkart service and packaging was good as always."
"best jee book for std.11-12.this book is magic of study and prepare for better result.this book is subject wise revision.this is fffffffffffaaaaaaannnnnnttttttttttaaaaaaassssssssstttttttttttttiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiikkkkkkkkkkkk"
"Perfect books for quick revision of all the concepts. although the theory given is insufficient, and its better to depend on the NCERT and the coaching notes for that, but overall, the questions given are really nice, and of JEE level.
A must buy for all Jee aspirants."
"
 marvellous book!!! each and every topic is covered and summarized in such a proper way that it makes the revision easy. The time table that is mentioned in it....can be appropriately followed easily.It is durable and study would indeed become fun.
Jee aspirants should definitely go for it......strongly recommendable....!!!! "

I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 so that author can remove errors in few worked out problems (e.g. a problem following very lengthy one in first chapter.) and i hope this point i mentioned doesnt under estimate the whole value of book. New author Ranjeet Shahi is my favourite author after i bought this one. Soon, i will buy Essentials of Organic chemistry by same author and give my feedback. "
"i bought this book. font size and shape of the contents are very much poor. the paper quality also very much poor. with in half-an-hour of reading, you will get irritation. you can t expect much quality from this book. 
this same publisher had published one good book for general knowledge, authored by tarun goyal. but i dont know why they have discontiued it from printing."
"Goood for people who fear from organic chemistry.......like me....Thanks arihant for making such wonderfull books....."
"It is a very informative book with all concepts mentioned appropriately, improves some of your necessary concepts and provides all the necessary guidance for preparation for iitjee. One of the best books for organic in market."

"I have bought this book from flipkart. It is a very good book, specially for those who are preparing for SSC exams. Small book but contains sufficient amount of knowledge of most of the topics. also the font size of the contents are also good and readable, will make reader interested."
"During last 2 years, after completing my Engineering from one of the very reputed NITs,though I have come across many books claiming to cover entire engineering syllabus, pecularity of this book is really remarkable. I, and many other students like me, who were in search of a book that can give a quick and error-free recap of the entire B.Tech. syllabus, will be greatly benefitted by this book. I would STRONGLY recommend this book to all those students who are sincerely preparing for the UPSC Engineering Services Examination or any other engineering competitive examination. 5 STAR from my side!!!"
"arihant is just copy paste type publisher, I purchased this book of arihant and IES, GATE, PSUs: A Handbook on Electronics and Communication Engineering (Paperback). I was surprised to see that the syllabus , topics covered and language is same for both the books. I called back to flipkart and ask to return a book or change it with another one but they denied ...........................now I have both the books."
"

"
 Wonderful book it summarises everything properly and as per need 
only thing is that it does not includes topics from last year as per PTU and others universities
still 4.75/5 rating 
if u are trying for Gate go for it, recommended, . "
"So many print errors are there on book. Content and coverage ok. Due to this wrong concept may induce."
"A good book as it includes most of the formulas and short explanations and notes. I bought it basically for gate preparation, but i found it also covers topics which are crucial for PSU exams. Only 1 limitation is that it doesnt contain Maths at all."
"good book. won t say great . Still you need to go and search for topics in depth. but really good if all you want is quick refresher"
"Nice piece of information under one roof for reference. It is helpful for GATE and PSU exams. One can refer it for College or University exams too. Powerful tool for ECE students who want rapid review of topics and related formulae."
"good book for those who know atleast some of the basics..just contain the short description........equations and all............................................"
"-Good book for quick review on formulas and some concepts...
-used for competitive exams..
-in some places there is printing mistake..
-overall book is good for new learners."
"this book covers all theory need for most prestigious exam in india jee advanced if u go through the book u will have ur misconcepts cleared do all illustration exercises and back exercises and u can even solve all the chapters related to this book in jee advanced and jee main also. Vol II is discontinued from arihant if i get that one also i am sure that i am going to attempt all jee questions in algebra"
"
 Nicely wriiten b S.K goyal , a book which clears all your concepts step by step..
Beginning from a lower level to the topmost..
Can be used as a TEXTBOOK for Algebra...
Must buy...!! "
"if u have just started then go for it.. this is a great book along with thoey, all syllabus and a large no. of questions.. so i am pretty satisfied with the book and this is amazing for algebra.. will help you through everything :)"
"A good IIT Paper consits of different levels of questions. These papers are entirely fifficult or enitrely easy. But they are good for practise and i recomend it. It does not consist a rank predictor as mentioned but has a good evaluation system. Best Of Luck !!"
"great product..worth it..am not sure about the maths part but chemistry and physics is upto the jee level.the best book for jee level tests in the market"
"nice and comprehensive few errors occasionally. It should the students appearing for JEE main exam."
"
 Sometimes our preparation is not just enough. we also need healthy mindset during jee exam.
and this book realy helped me. "
"I dont say it is a total waste but to a limit it is.They donot have solutions except for JEE advenced subjective questions.And every chapter contains nearly 100 qusetions out of which there are 10-15 Jee Advanced subjective questions.Also they have only 10-18 solved Illustrative examples of which most of them are not so tough.All books in this series are of same condition including Mechanics II,Waves & Thermodynamics,Electricity and Magnetism,Optics and Modern Physics and this one.Just think before you buy.Sometimes you feel different & sometimes you feel the same as Me."
"The book does not clear basic concepts...it touches them..but you wont understand it thoroughly after going through the book...there are standard and tough problems...but exercises could have been graded better..like u need knowledge of later chapters for solving questions from an earlier one...some problems are over the top n not needed for JEE...buy dis if u are good in phys...this book wont improve understanding of the topic"
"Really Good Book....excellent for quick revision....questions are good....contains both JEE Mains and Advance Level Questions..!!!"
"a masterpiece by Dr D C Pandey.
indeed a book for understanding physics at core level.amazing theory the best I ve read,
numerical are not that difficult,but essential for building up crystal clear concepts.
most of the books by arihant publications are amazing."
"the book is a must have for all IIT aspirants....the best part it bridges and involves the reader intricately .....if you do these......be rest assured you ll not face any problems in the paper....H C verma can be substituted by these....GO FOR THEM ALL BOOKS OF THE SERIES....AND YOUR EXPERIENCE WILL BE PHENOMENONAL IF U R DEDICATED....."
"The books are charming as always. The pleasant language makes you want to read more. Its the subjective questions that I love the most. Its interesting to do and covers the entire topics. Among the series, I like Mechanics and thermodynamics the most."
"
 definitely a great book for those who want to be good in mechanics. It covers all type of problems and illustrations. you will actually get to know the key trap where students fall in and that often paper setter like to give.
Being good in mechanics will fetch you a decent rank in jee and chapters in this book are the building blocks of important chapters like rotational dynamics. 
I will strongly recommend this book for JEE aspirants.
and FLIPKART rocks!!!!!!! "
"This book in Mechanics is undoubtedly the best in the market. We get exactly what we need for preparing for JEE. 
Theory Has been given perfectly. The language is simple and the author elaborates on the points which are difficult to understand.
The problems are excellent. Most of the problems make you think.
The beauty of the Exercises given is each problem given in them teaches us how to use the concept in a different way.
The bifurcation into JEE main and Advanced makes our preparation even easier.
I strongly recommend buying this book as Mechanics forms a very important part of the JEE syllabus
Delivery from Flipkart was awesome!!"
"A wonderful book from the house of Arihant through Flipkart.the book is very valuable and worth every penny you give.the book was brand new when i received it.thanx to Flipkart"
"It has a concise and exhaustive theory apt for entrances exams. Plenty of questions to practise. It s the book to have if yo re appearing for medical entrances."
"its a complete package of study material , includes level 1 , level 2 and previous year problems and has detailed solution of each n every question...and level of questions is also up to the mark , as required in competitive exams ...i m lovin it"
"I have nothing to complain about the servise. Just Flawless. But the books are just worthless, as is any other book by an indian author. My advice to all, never buy academic books from Indian authors. Buy the bhagwad gita for gods sakes."
"this is very very good book contains all 35 years IIT JEE questions.but only problem is in some problem solution is given in very short format otherwise it is superb expect that change in next edition,i will also add that if they give calculations in brief it will be useful.this is a must buy book for the all jee student. it will increase your confidence.i hope next edition will be much much better then this one.this is a must buy book.just buy it.an it is nearly 50% discount on flipkart.com.soo what you are thinking soo and grab it.you are getting one year question paper at less then \xe2\x82\xb9 3. at the starting summary is given in short."
"ONLY one thing---------FLIPKART rocks!!.....superb solved paper from arihant...i m a medical student but after solving iit jee last years questions,i feel confidence now can tackle medical entrance exam physics question easily.....A MUST BUY"
"it was a use ful material for to prepare for IIT examination and also it helped me to prepare for my next ISC examination i recomend this book to the students who are going to participate in IIT entrance examination."
"I had always feared about the types of questions that would come in JEE Advance.This book has cleared all of them. Not only that,I now gain confidence about Physics.Everyone should buy the book for Advance"
"
 when it comes about undrstandin d concept on whic jee is based this buk n d handbook of physics provide a ready made n up to mark idea as well as result oriented teachin.....
good service by flipkart "
"I think its the best book with a low cost for completing physics even if you start from XII std.This book contains synopsis of nearly 50 pages covering every topics which are awesomely written by D.C PANDEY . They contain detailed explanations along with all important formulas which are necessary for solving Mcq\ s quickly.Regrading the Mcq\ s,they are nearly about 50-60 sums in all important chapters and 20-30 sums in other chapters.They are all entrance examination questions which are best and even harder than H.C VERMA as u know they are \ Arihant\ questions. Finally this book is worth and very useful for \ JEE MAINS\ ."
"Really awesome book and as always, really fast service from flipkart...Contains good questions and acceptable solutions to them as well....Really helped me a lot to cope with my extra studies....Truly an awesome buy....."
"For practice it is not good book. Al the question not covered.36 years for name shake only.this can be used as question pattern check purpose only."

Now, coming to the book, the paper quality is good enough. Rest is as expected from any other 35 years papers. You can see, the solved paper of 2013 is given. So don t worry, buy it."
"
 The book is best if you know every holy shit and then go for the sums, for a class 11 student, if you study n finish a single chapter and then go for this book to solve question from the same chapter, it will not be ideal for you!
there is absolutely no emphasis on basics or concept building, just some formulas are presented at the beginning of each Chapter and then you are asked to solve!
But the systematic Approach is phenomenal and the solutions provided is pin point and worthy of appreciation. "
"By seeing the name 35 years solved question papers I ordered ........finally it contains all concepts and formulas before every chapter but it does not contain that many number of questions which I expected....not satisfied"
"i would like to thanks Flipkart for quick delivery.......but let me tell you something about the book 
pros
collections of all jee questions chapterwise
solutions are also given
fair price
at the beginning of every chapter study material is given for quick revision

"Great book for the final preparations, gives an idea to the pattern of ques papers of iitjee and includes detailed solutions"
"
 Recommend this book to those who are trying for IIT and BITSAT.
As the title suggests it has unsolved questions of AIEEE ( IIT Mains) and also has questions of IIT Advanced "
"easy to understand the pattern of icwai foundation and helped me lot to solve and understand statistics problems...."
"Awesome contents, an ideal study material for preparation of polytechnic exam and of course Flipkart s delivery service was awesome. I was shopping first time from flipkart and I am very much satisfied."
"Don t touch this book before reading the main course books...
the book have some important notes to read before solving question so that you will remember the main points before solving questionss....
A bad book atlast...."
" 
Best book for JEE main. help in advance also.
The book is very good for jee main preparation. Theory is given in brief. Best way to have a revision of old lessons but useful to set them on my mind in little time 
Pros:
1) problems at the end of every day makes the lesson good and help to judge how the preparation is.
2) The problems are very related to JEE main syllabus and explanation is good enough. 
Cons:
Not a good choice for JEE advance but it can help for advance level also. 
A good piece from the house of Arihant. "
"except for the question coverage from old mains papers and NCERT Exemplar the rest of the book is useless."
"First of all, reviewing the book from Arihant. This book is good for practice. 
It has got tooo many mistakes in it(Arihant is famous for mistakes). 
First go through a chapter s preview that is available on arihant s website.
Important chapters have more no. of questions for practice. I bought this book mainly for practice purpose, i.e just for question solving, and it does fulfill my needs. I got through many of the mistakes till now and students with decent knowledge will realize the 
mistakes."
"this is the ultimate book for jee aspirants if u have not bought it buy as quickly as posssible
i myself have personally used this book and has been benefitted and flipkart is ofeering it at a very low price so make sure u r the first to buy this book. with regards and best wishes for jee aspirants........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................."
"This book is awesome.It tells all about what you want to study and what not on the basis of previous 5 years. and it also tells what percentile comes from 11th an 12th and topic wise questions which came in previous years. Only one regret and that is it has a limited theory only for them those who already know every thing. But again its a crash course. So i say go for it................."
"IT IS QUITE USEFUL. I GOT IT QUICKLY FOR MY QUICK NEED. I RECEIVED THE PACK IN TACT TO MY RESIDENTIAL ADDRESS . THANKING YOU"
"This book is awesome. It covers the whole syllabus of JEE MAIN, Each topic is divided into a chapter and the chapter contains around 50 - 60 questions which is to be solved in 1 day. The exercises also contain previous year questions from JEE MAIN & AIEEE with proper solutions. If you solve the whole book, you will gain a lot of confidence for JEE MAIN. It helped me a lot in my preparation and with its help I was able to crack JEE MAIN. I started studying from this book in January and completed it in mid Feb. Overall, It is very nice book for JEE MAIN."
"
 I brought this book for JEE main It has average of 60 questions for each chapter And also the questions of jee main which came previous years 
This book is well for prepartion but if u r preparing for advanced also the opot for some good book such as BL Sharma (arihant) ... "
"he book was really helpful .... I cleared the JEE mains by self study frm this book... really Awesome"
"
 many errors i thing mtg 10 year book will be a better book than this.......
waste of money
page quality poor
many out of syllabus questions "
"The book is indeed helpful for WBJEE Engg. preparations but one must be a bit cautious as there are certain mistakes in the solutions."
"If you are doing your last minutes preparation this is the book you will love. The papers are good and it will help you."
"My brother have read the book for the for his preparation for WB JEE. A good book with good paper quality and printing quality."
"
 Had used it during my exams, purchased from flipkart. As usual great service by flipkart!
go for it, it will surely help during exams! "
"
 i used this book its good with more than a information that one needs.
nice great job done by Arihant Publication.
hope your other kind will be soon in my hand.
also great delivery job done by Flipkart.
Best wishes to both for their future development. "
"I just wasted my money buying this book which i ordered for my brother. He had some previous question papers of JMI and not even single question matched in the same year question papers or i found in the whole book."
"This is good book if you have less time, and more course to complete in 1 to 2 months, (mainly for JMI after waste in JEE Mains)
But I ll I want to tell to Flipkart and to all, that , rate of some books is more on flipkart than Snapdeal, I want to use flipkart due to effective servicing and great experience.
But price matters, so I ll request to flipkart to reduce its price.
(Baki book to bht badiya h bhai ;) )"
"It cannot clear your concepts the book confuses you if you are buying this to start your preparation it totally waste of money"
"Flipkart delivered it in two day. awsum flipkart delivery. The book is good with the hints easy two understand. However I got a printing mistake in a hint but its OK."
"
 THE BOOK IS REALLY GOOD............................................................. 
BUT IT PROVIDES QUESTION PAPERS ONLY NO SUMMARY OR OTHER CONTENTS.
FLIPKART DELIVERY WAS AWESOME "
"
 They set the book in right way it is only for practice .
means if you are looking for a book which provide theory then it not for you .
it is like mock test before going to real challenge. "
"The book awwsome , the writer has done a hard work combinig all the graphs in one book , hats-off to Amit Agarwal , I gave JEE Mains 2014 and JEE Advanced 2014 in both the exams , questions asked were easily solved with the techniques and graphs given in this book. !! A must buy for all Competitive Exam Pursuers.. !!"
"
 A good book for math lovers.This book provides an easy way to solve some sort of problems through graphs which we cant solve through theoretical means.Definitely it will be an asset for students preparing for various competitive exams. 
Special Mention:- I know flipkart is fast.....but flipkart reached beyond my expectations.Delivered the product in one and half day! "
"arihant Rocks !!!
Do read this book....and your concepts on Graphs Will Be clear...and also a Bit Of Calculus will be clear !!
And the rest is a Surprise for You To Read and find Out !!"
"
 as usual, a fine book. even one with little algebra and trigo knowledge can understand graphs clearly. 
 just go for it "
"i bought this book a year ago , read through it(not full) , and trust me , it taught me how to play with graphs. now i actually extend the problem( integration , differentiation , quadratic , lpp etc) to graphs and solve it graphically where ever possible."
"
 it is really good.if u stdy it well, you have a good chance to clear iit jee.flipkart delivery 
was also qiuite good. "
"
 The product was delivered by BLUE DART and every time they delivered the ordered product from FLIPKART, they asked for the payment even when the payment had already been made online. 
This is the third time they did this. 
However there is no issue with the product itself, book was in a very good condition. "
"Graphs help to do questions in a very easy way ..and this book serves the purpose really well. Its a well written book. Recommended to every body preparing for competitive exams...."
"One of those books that give u knowledge not just education.. Very helpful book in understanding various functions and how they are plotted and their unique identities..i read this book to relax myself from other studies as it really is very interesting and complicated (in a good way)"
"It includes all the graphs as well as there transformation in questions! very useful and worth buying it.."
"Everyone who is going to any coaching should refer this book. I am in FIITJEE.........................................................................."
"All of this arihant math series are very useful. This book has a lot of information in the specially permutation and combination. It would be better if the proof of the formulas in some chapters were given. But to crack JEE ADVANCE you do not need the proof. You will need those if you love mathematics. Still it is a very good Book for JEE ADVANCE."
"ok ok type book .if you are looking for complex numbers,this is excellent"
"
 This is a great book for those who want to prepare for jee algebra.Has nice theory and most of the questions are descriptive and good.But the objective ones fall short of expectations.
Go for it if you are not looking for a lot of objectives.
The delivery by flipkart and the book quality was commendable "
"The perfect book to buy for iit jee algebra ! The Questions are right about enough ! The Quetions are really challenging and are at jee level ! I would suggest this book to all iit aspirants!"
"
 Must have book for all JEE aspirants!
Contains all the necessary chapters.....and good techniques!
All thanx to flipkart for delivering it in less than 24 hours :) "
"The best bookn for calculus if you are seriously preparing for JEE. The whole sereis of maths and physics is good but this is the best of the lot.Wonderfully explained concepts and neat tips and tricks to approach problems."
"The book contains too many topics which are not even in the syllabus today, even if you purchase then it s not a bad option to gain hand on integration .But mind to maintain time for it everyday!"
"
 JUst no need to buy any other book.
Do each and every example and question of each and every exercise and that will definately make u a master of INTEGRAL CALCULUS.
:) "
"Very Good. Well explained. Most importantly, good examples after each short theory. Good Problems on Scalar Triple Product and Vector Triple Product. A Good Buy. However, I feel scope of improvement exists."
"The main advantage is the target exercise and the points to consider...The theory part is too good.The graphs shown also of very good help.The author has also helped in removing misconception."
"Nice book, concept clarification is good, good questions. It is nice book for Engineering entrances exam. Delivery by Flipkart as usual fast."
"THIS IS A GREAT BOOK THAT CONTAINS EVERYTHING OF TRIGONOMETRY REQUIRED FOR PREPARATION OF JEE MAIN AND ADVANCED. GREAT SHIPPING SERVICE FROM FLIPKART. ALTOGETHER IT IS EXCELLENT......!!!!!!"
"one of the best for preparation of jee with if one wants to clarify concepts if you can solve the questions given in this book then you can definetly solve the questions asked in jee best book for mains for advance take some reference from other books with this one also.as usual the flipkart delivery was awsome."
"This book is awesome with every theory explained in detail. All the topics of JEE Advanced are properly covered in accordance with the syllabus. Every concept is derived properly followed by illustrations and an exercise after every topic. Also some shortcuts to remember formulas are given. In short excellent book for students taking students from basics to JEE Advance level problems step wise !!!!!"
"This book by Dr sk goyal is mind blowing.Every concept is given in detail with introductory exercises and advanced level exercises.go for it...it is worth it"
"I think if u want to compet with ur classes teacher just read some concept one day prior and u will be a topper in ur class.This is amazingly best book for coordinate geometry.plzz buy it if u want to crack iit."
"
 Thanks flipkart for delivering it in 20 hours!
The book is just awesome.....must have for all jee aspirants! "
"i am really convinced that this is the best book for calculus for iit jee preparation.
Has a very good part of functions, limits, graphical transformations. Really worth solving.
If you are a jee aspirant...you must go with it."
"very nice book.. covers whole course. it explain us from base and goes to high level. like it very much."
"Pros : 1. Covers the whole sylabbus.
 2. Bridges the gap between the concept in the textbook to examination problems.
 Hence, it has the two most important characteristic we look for in a book.
Cons : Frankly , I can t think of anything
So overall if you cover the book sincerely and do all the problems, I think calculus will become a piece of cake for you."
"Make Calculus strong using it... Buy on Flipkart......I want to appear in JEE 2016 and for that I had this book .....So a classic Book . C L A S S I C B O O K , there is no other such type of book available. So,,,, B U Y O N F L I P K A R T...."
"well explained theory with quality solved and unsolved problems.............must have for jee aspirants"
"
 To say the book was perfect for JEE(MAINS & ADV),
But the author concentrated more on Quality of Questions, and forgot about the Theory...
The Theory was a bit not well organized..
Overall it was Good..!!! "
"I hate organic. Had to buy this book because me professor suggested for it. But this book does not really provide great explanation. From FLIPKART S side it was good but the book is bad...."
"the content of the book is good but still the feeling goes away on seeing the paper quality and the poor binding also there are some pages coming out of the book making it a disaster to reader!!!!!!!!!"
"awesome book . great explaination and superb sums .best book for chemistry .hats off chemistry never easier than before"
"If you are not good enough at physical chemistry, this is the book to go with. Although questions are not that much but still covers a lot of syllabus of boards too. Only for beginners who are starting to prepare for JEE not for question solving."
"The book was labelled 2013 but the content inside the book was all of 2011 with thousands of printing mistakes. 
In fact at one of the places REPUBLIC DAY WAS WRITTEN TO BE ON 15th AUGUST.
Go for it if its cheap and fun for you."
"i bought this product,not from flipkart. 
This book has a lot of mistakes in it, After reading something you will be in a confusion that what you read is correct or wrong !
After buying this book u will have to purchase another one like Lucent s General Knowledge"
"
 Good book with excellent graded problems. Theory is straight forward as they mention. At least some very little basic chemistry understanding is needed for succesfully reading this book. Whatever the reason, i liked this book unconditionally. It should be useful compared to other books available in market. 
I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 so that author can remove errors in few worked out problems (e.g. a problem following very lengthy one in first chapter.) and i hope this point i mentioned doesnt under estimate the whole value of book. New author Ranjeet Shahi is my favourite author after i bought this one. Soon, i will buy Essentials of Organic chemistry by same author and give my feedback. "
"i bought this book. font size and shape of the contents are very much poor. the paper quality also very much poor. with in half-an-hour of reading, you will get irritation. you can t expect much quality from this book. 
this same publisher had published one good book for general knowledge, authored by tarun goyal. but i dont know why they have discontiued it from printing."
"Goood for people who fear from organic chemistry.......like me....Thanks arihant for making such wonderfull books....."
"It is a very informative book with all concepts mentioned appropriately, improves some of your necessary concepts and provides all the necessary guidance for preparation for iitjee. One of the best books for organic in market."
"
 This review comes from a serious Mba aspirant.A book with 600 pages of information in the form of over 6000 questions (avg 70-80 qns) on the all the topics mentioned. 
Salient features: 
*Questions arranged-subject wise and chapter-wise.
*Collection of IAS,PCS,NDA,CDS,SSC etc qns up to 2012.
*Almost all accurate ans. 
Really loved it. Latest edition and wonderful print quality.
just go for it!! "
"This is a very good book in organic chemistry it has helped me a lot in understanding the subject in the simplest possible way. a lot of solved examples are given which is great in understanding and a variety of practice problems have also been given which makes it one of the best book in organic chemistry
GO FOR THIS ONE, IT LL HELP YOU A LOT."
"
 best Book for organic chemistry includes all topics for JEE and contains all concepts along with examples to understand 
Great book good distribution of chapters 
go for it!!!!!!!!
BEST BOOK FOR ORGANIC CHEMISTRY "
"I have bought this book from flipkart. It is a very good book, specially for those who are preparing for SSC exams. Small book but contains sufficient amount of knowledge of most of the topics. also the font size of the contents are also good and readable, will make reader interested."
"
 This is a very good book for advanced learners. Problems are strength point of this book. very valuable.
Theory is very clear and at least should be learnt 2 times for initial grasp for average students.
Students, please have a good grasp over all basics of chemical bonding, hybridization, polarity etc before opening this book.
This book will not be like a very easy book to start learning organic chemistry without fundamentals of general chemistry. "
"hi students! I suggest u all not to buy this book . Initially , this book appears to be highly useful but once u take the course harder u will face chapters such as aldehydes and ketones, alkyl halides , acid derivatives , etc. , the author hasn t given us the entire theory !!!!! instead , i suggest u to buy organic chemistry by k s verma . its the best book in the market for iitjee organic chem . TRUST ME coz i m victim of this book :-("
"This book has got amazing and sufficient explanation of each and every chapter. It has small questions after every little explanation which helps a lot! If you target JEE - Advanced, you must go for this! The language used is also not complicated. I m a Fan!"
"
 this is most comprehensive book in maths for IIT JEE prepratioin ,a must buy, most authentic problem in context of JEE difficulty level.
But it gets little boring and some of question are unnessory.
but overall a great book. "
"
 As I said this one of the best mathematics book available for Engineering entrance in India. The book has relevant and quite illustrated Theory ,solved examples are good in quantity as well as quality and problems level are from easy to hard not so challenging problems are included.but the included ones are fair enough to get a handsome rank in jee. Solutions to all problems are given this is quite helpful it makes u realize and compare ur approach towards questions.Previous years questions from major entrances around the country are included.So all is there what a Jee Aspirant needs.
The thing about the book I like is that it has all the formats of questions Jee asks means u will have a good practice on pattern of Jee before the D-Day. "
"if anyone solves this book vry crefully nd precisely den he/she may crack IIT.
it s recommende to buy this book"
"
 I am happy with this book. It is a good book for practice for IIT mathematics.
Flipkart delivered it to me before time in good condition. "
"This Book Will Help U To Strength Ur Basics And Help U To Do High Level Sums And Will Also Help To Clear All Ur Concepts Of Class 12."
"The content in this book written by Amit M Aggarwal is a must read for all the students. The book expresses all the fundamental and sophisticated details and concepts of Mathematics. Recommended for all. And thanks to Flipkart services for delivering the book in well condition within the scheduled time."
"I would suggest this book to everyone. The theory part is very good and it contains a lots of objective questions along with the solutions provided. After searching through many books i bought it finally and i can say that this is the best book for JEE according to me. Just go for it."
"Useful book for any serious jee contender. It is helping me the most in jee preparation. It gives me exactly what I need , same type of problems which are asked in jee."
"Not Bad , But problems in the book are definitely not of the same difficulty level as in jee adv or other top notch exams"
"its a nice book with more than 8000 questions with approx 350 questions per chapter i am not going to any coaching classes ,this book is highly recommended for all those who did not go to coaching classes for jee , instead of spending lakhs of rupees on this coaching classes one can prefer such books ,which will prove to be the best replace of the material provided there so go on buy this, and above all FLIPKART THE SERVIECE JUST ROCKS, keep going and rise above all your rivals. BEST OF LUCK !!!!!"
"This is great book with variety of questions....Great book for jee preparation...but quality of pages is not good....."
"
 Please dont buy it. It is of no use.I find the questions lack difficulty and competitiveness. There are about 50 questions of the same type in each chapter. 
I regret spending 500 rupees on this book. "
"
 VERY VERY GOOD BOOK TO STUDY FOR JEE ADVANCED. ITS A TREASURE OF ALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS!!!! 
I refer this book to all who wish to appear for jee advanced "
"great book.the problem solving level has been gradually increased from nil to expertise.the exhaustive number of questions is gives adequate practice for jee.Overall a splendid book.but the quality of pages is not good."
"good book. but very less synopsis.variety of questions included..can buy this.have to know the concepts thoroughly before starting with MCQs ."
"best for iit jee preperation ..my coaching centre suggested arihant books...
its superb!! 
it contains organic,physical&inorganic chemistry 
it is an excellent for practise"
"This one is good enough for entrance. Enough questions. Good effort. With important solutions tis best MCQ book. Referred to all AIEEE students."
"want to really crack iit advanced solve it regularly and if you don t get any problem, solution are there so no need to worry"
"Book is very fascilating...It contains each and every Question IIT-JEE point of view as well as JEE-mains BUT This is a practice book, only contains question and solutions Its not a conceptual book.So For basics you can refer to other books and then you can practice this one."
"This is book is really nice for jee main.It is very helpful..organic part looks a bit tough ,but the 10 practice tests are of very good quality :)"
"this is waste of money. no fundamentals are discussed . i did not expect from Arihant atleast. they have published many good books but why publish such books i do not know"
"The topics are explained quite neatly.The concept s touched are those of 1th and 12th at the same time too much detail is not given. Just give the particular topic a go after reading this book and you will in act be able to solve quite a lot of JEE Main/Advanced problems"
"It was a good book variety of problems and answers very easy to understand it is worth the money that i have spend"
"
 a good book for the preparation of jee mains.
A lot of mistakes as usual but on the whole a good one from the house of arihant. "
"its a so so book for a complete revision before the mains exam ........... but i prefer arihant master resource books than this"
"
 A good book for last month revision.
omitting one star for some mistakes 
verdict you can go for it :) "
"This is a very good book. I am using it not only for JEE but it was also handy during the revision for board exams.
However I would certainly not advise this for advance!"
"a so so book for last moment preparation covering all topicd... but i prefer arihant master resource book than this"
"GOOD BOOK FOR LAST MOMENT PREPARATION. A MUST HAVE BOOK FOR JEE MAIN ASPIRANTS. BUY IT FOR REVISION OF WHOLE SYLLABUS."
"Very good easy good book high user friendly home delivery very good contained every thing that specified"
"Best book for quality questions for jee mains! Take this book and get the confidence required to attempt such a calibre of exam like the jee."
"There is no doubt that the book keeps it s promise.
But the way these have been presented ,i.e., the page numbers and copy paste from older edition of the book, is a disappointment.
At least they should have arranged them in proper page number!!"
"Hola guys.To all jee aspirants out there This book is for us.I bought it from online arihant store for 760.I got it yesterday and I am already in love with it.The beautiful and attractive cover page,neatly scripted and great look over the jee main syllabus are the major highlights where as Its heavy size makes you uncomfortable to carry.You would get a free booklet and CD which are of great use.Started solving the questions and there are many in it.I hope that this book paves me a way into the glorious NIT S or IIIT s out there.ALL THE BEST TO YOU GUYS!!!"
"the books is good in terms of theory ,tests but chapter wise questions are not good most of them are from NCERT exampler and the rest are also not of mains level"
"
 This book is excellent. The questions are toughest.. If one solve its problems, he has a good chance in IIT exam.. But one must have thorough knowledge of basic physics and knowledge of inegration and differentiation.. The language is bit difficult and symbols used are not standard actually.. So I had some problems in starting.
But its a great book. "
"The problems in General Physics by I.E Irodov is a spectacular book containing numerous problems and numericals that will put you to the test.I recommend using The Concepts of Physics by HC Verma to go through the Theory and Concepts and then try to solve the problems as it ll be a lot easier.A must have for IIT-JEE and AIEEE aspirants."
"
 its an excellent book with lot of good questions to solve. it is handy too and a book everyone should keep. i e irodov is a very good author and this book has been written in a very good way.
lot many problems of all types including graphs are there along with their answers.
very good book for competitive exams.!!! "
"THIS IS ONE OF THE FINEST BOOK FOR IITJEE PREPARATION 
THERE ARE 1800 PROBLEMS AND OUT IF THIS 1800,IF ONE SOLVE AROUND 1400 PROBLEMS HE/SHE WILL SURELY CTACK IITJEE PHYSICS PORTION
I WOULD RECOMMEND this book.........."
"You must try this If u think u know physics well , its a nice book , with tough questions , ideal for IIT Jee (Even though solving whole book is not necessary for iit-jee , its good for solving problems )"
"
 An Excellent Book for those who like to test their fundamentals. The Paper Quality the overall appearance is quite satisfactory.
Although it is a QUESTION only book you can download its solutions from internet.
If you are not going to any coaching then its a must buy. "
"Best book for IIT preparation...Contains all sorts of problem from variety of topics which are important for jee ..II recommend you to also buy solutions for the book, as that will help you to grasp the concepts well....Overall a must have for engineering entrance aspirants.."
"
 Good book with challenging problems. it covers all the topics which are included in any competitive engineering examinations and is a good choice for anyone who wants to test his knowledge of physics. the gradation of problems is phenomenal and the choice is questions are tricky, challenging as well as interesting. 
And Flipkart service, as usual - SPOT ONN!!!!! "

"It is a very informative book with all concepts mentioned appropriately, improves some of your necessary concepts and provides all the necessary guidance for preparation for iitjee. One of the best books for organic in market."
"

"This is a very good book in organic chemistry it has helped me a lot in understanding the subject in the simplest possible way. a lot of solved examples are given which is great in understanding and a variety of practice problems have also been given which makes it one of the best book in organic chemistry
GO FOR THIS ONE, IT LL HELP YOU A LOT."
"
 best Book for organic chemistry includes all topics for JEE and contains all concepts along with examples to understand 
Great book good distribution of chapters 
go for it!!!!!!!!
BEST BOOK FOR ORGANIC CHEMISTRY "
"I have bought this book from flipkart. It is a very good book, specially for those who are preparing for SSC exams. Small book but contains sufficient amount of knowledge of most of the topics. also the font size of the contents are also good and readable, will make reader interested."
"The price of the book is very cheap and so as the content in it. I don t recommend to buy this book anytime. The author could have done additional work and added some adequate additional stuff to make this book a really useful one."
"this book is really good if u need practice in questions....gr8 questions with their solutions!!this book could not b much better!!! hats off 2 flipkart for super duper fast delivery....keep up the good work!!!"
"
 it is a good book for iit 
but little bit difficult for the starters 
for the starters a book by NCERT named examplar is good but it is not easily available in the market "
"It is one of the best books for maths in iitjee level. It doesnot have any theory but the collection of problems are really good. It is of the same level as arihant books and a good book for practice"
"It s actual price was around 1400 but I got it from flipkart for 800! Really good books, contains only questions , and no theory. In fact , it contains all types of questions asked in JEE from comprehensions to multiple choice to integer type questions , and the too Topic wise . 
It allows one to test their knowledge of the topic. I would recommend either this series or the 35 year IIT papers series to all aspirants ( Both are great). And for revision , this is probably the best book."
"compared to other websites this is the best platform to buy things which is cheaper as well as the best quality"
"One of the good books for organic chemistry for IIT JEE and other comp exams in India, not many even know about this book so I d call this a very underrated book. Surely worth the 300 you pay for it, large number of problems on a variety of patterns that is required to crack the jee examination."
"nice book for revise in short time and more concepts covered, and i am happy with service and book
its very easy to revise all conversions in one book"
"one of the most easy book to understand the difficult concepts of chemical bonding . with main focus on drago rule and diagram representation to make it easier for the readers with comprehensive evaluation with subjective and brain challenging objective exercise... 
thanks to sir for writing such a competitive book for the students wishing to excel in chemical bonding at higher level and competitions . 
tushar"
"The Book Gives Good Facts And Concept But But Does Not Cover Whole Topic. Gives Quantity Of Problems To Build Your Concept Upon."
"By going through this book one develops concept essential for iit-jee exams. this book should be taken at an early stages for studing chemistry as a subject. This book is full of some special periodic trends in properties"
"
 not as much as impressive as accepted concepts are given but i think author is diverted from the path and i think some of the answers are also wrong so think once before purchasing 
if you aare thinking that detail study is given then also it not up to th mark "
"Realy nice book for chemical bonding.Liked it very much ,the concepts are explained in a ver interesting manner,easy shortcut methods for many concepts.Fully satisfied.Cheap comparing to the contents and explanation of concepts.As it is done very well!!!"
"It s an awsome book for the prepration of chemical bonding. In this book every topic is explained in the excllent manner. This book also have so many practise questions. 
Thanks to Vaibhav Trivedi for writing such an awsome book for us....

"this book is not as good as other iit foundation books in market , even though it claims to be no 1 . this book has copy paste material . no chapter is originally written everything is copied from cbse text books. it is good for students who wanna excel in exams(cbse), but this book is very disappointing for students who want to go ahead of school book and want to excel in olympiads."
"Very good book for reference. Students will be happy to read this book along with their regular class books. Helpful for all."
"a quality book in the series for iit jee. optics part is very comprehensive. modern physics could be improvised. overall a good book for practicing"

Brilliant service by flipkart, got it the next day. "
"
 For serious JEE Mains aspirants this one is really handy, provides you chapterwise questions from PCM... as well as is cheaper than other AIEEE books
Also as usual,flipkart was quick in delivering the product to our doorstep...
GRAB YOUR COPY ! "
"I ordered it for my niece..index was missing from the book...
one page was missing. only half index was present. you can imagine the problem without index especially when its a topic was solved paper ."
"
 This book is not that good as it has missed many questions , and some of its solutions are irrelevant , so if you want to have an AIEEE test paper collection , try for other publishers, but be aware of the price too !!
Overall , it can be judged as an ordinary book "
"Not bad but too precise. If you want to somehow pass the entrance test this book is OK otherwise not too much helpful. Not for higher rank holders in NEET-UG. This book can never be a best seller as other medical entrance books of Disha. Infact other publications are far better but if you look at the positive side, its a good book for amateurs. 
One of the greatest backdrop of this book is that questions are not of that high standard that is as of the exam. Price of the book is suited to its quality."
"this book is really great. It gives many idea about medical entrance exams. I like it very much. but it would be better by giving more no of explanations. this flipkart is really good because it helps me to buy this type of books and read it. I have searched many stores around my city but i could no find this type of books."
"questions are ncert based therefore its only for neet not helpful for other exams. The best part is that there is an duplicate omr answer sheet and analysis sheet so that you can judge your speed and analysis the weak chapters. But paper quality must be considered."
"-I found this book pretty sufficient. 
-It has papers from 2002-2012 but each paper has atleast 2 mistakes in its answer key. 
-2011 (Reshceduled) paper had more than 33% incorrect answers in answer key. Although the solutions had the corrections so no worry.
-The 5 mock tests at the end are good but at a higher level than JEE Main.
-Worth a buy for the previous years papers if you didn t find anything else."
"
 this book is really useful specially for the zoology portion. human physiology, animal kingdom, human health and diseases are explained very well.i strongly recommend this book.thanks narang sir and flipkart for this. "
"My daughter is doing her 11th (ISC) and has also started her preparation for medical entrance simultaneously. Some 10 years experienced teacher has recommended this book. So, Go ahead."
"
 I found this book very useful to me.The book follows the exact syllabus of All India Medical Entrance Exams. It contains almost all details needed for cracking major PMT exams. ACE Biology For NEET Medical Entrance Exams is a must-have for all medical students.
Being amazed by the splendid service of FlipKart, I must pray to God to help reach the organisation its peak to help us. "
"This book s simply wow!! It contains almost all details needed for cracking major PMT exams. Combined with NCERT textbook, it is a unstoppable force to get ur biology strengthened. All students must buy the book for clear concepts, which are provided in easily accessible points, with necessary headings. There are many exercises in mid for testing memory and knowledge.
In short, I feel blessed!"
"good book indeed , must buy.....

"this propagates the idea of rote method in organic chemistry.never seen a book of this kind for this good cost.I STRONGLY TELL DON T BUY THIS. it does not give mechanisms for maximum reactions.just waste of money and effort. op tandon has a good publicizing factor which makes this book famous.just try something else"
"Very good book, well detailed. By the time you will finish a chapter from this book, you will have a clear concept of the chapter."
"This book provides an insight into the world of organic chemistry.Best for the preparation of JEE (MAINS + ADVANCED)."

"Pros: 
1. Concepts explained in depth
2. High levels problems are there
3. JEE Advance problems are present
4.It has all formulae at one place 
Cons:
1.If you are looking a book for JEE Mains, then this book may not look useful to you
2.Has ONLY High level problems"
"Complete coverage of all topics in detail. Also beneficial for CBSE exams. Great author, great book. The quality of print is good. Eduwiser s series was recommended by my teacher. I am thankful for introducing me to these books by Prof. K. C. Sinha"
"This book contains only few objective questions in general. Half the book is previous year solved paper of IES. I would not recommend it for any PSU exams or revision purposes."
"Awesome book, disha publications!!..I was able to understand each and every concept very clearly. Also, topics have simple language and not out of syllabus. I loved it!!!!!!"
"All IIT aspirants will love this book as it includes all the topics and explains them in examples. paper quality is sober but variety of questions make this an excellent book for preparation in IIT-JEE mains and advanced. good work Disha!!!"

 A book with great variety of questions, precise and important content.
Moreover, totally solved question bank is just icinig to the cake. 
I highly recommend to all............. "
"
 really good book ..... 
good for preparation of entrance exam with fully solved question with tricks and easy to understand the language. "
"It is a very helpful book in terms of content. excellent for preparing for IIT-ADVANCED. i would prefer this book because it s easy to understand and not so difficult."
"I bought this book when its price is over 650 and i feel really cheated because i think this book is for self study.The font of this book is worst.You feel sleepy when you read it in night.Their is lack in concept for Some chapter like chemical bonding,chemical kinetics,colligative properties(worst).Some is too elobrated like thermodaynamics,ionic.
I recommand go for arihant s ranjeet shani physical chem."
"
 u can refer this for your physical chem..
good book..
some small mistakes...tht can be easily identified..
rest part is super..(y) "
"
 I expected more about this book 
I disappointed after I bought
but some concepts surface chemistry,electro chemistry are good 
Chemical kinetics is too worst in this book
Mole concept is explained in very good level ... 
so on average this is not bad book but some concepts like chemical kinetics are too bad... "
"It is a good book...contains good theory ...contains lots of mcqs.Answers are given although the solutions are not there."
"Wonderful book for iit jee preparations...
n if ua gettin such good offers on flipkart don miss it...its worth it!! i got it for just 261!! 
its got everything u need...great work by the authors..really satisfied...jus a prob wid print quality...but the content is great and its worth it!"
"good book fot jee main and advance nice explanation and questions very good solved examples questions are also solved by short cuts"
"The books are perfect for preparation of IIT JEE. This book includes all master questions which help to develop key concepts. Examples are even more better and solution of them with help of shortcuts are given. Theory is easy to understand and very precised. I have done many analysis from them and have seen a lot of improvement in me. Formulas with some brief explanation at end of the chapter helps in quick revision and increasing output. My advice is that you should read these books and see the gain in your performanc"
"Disha publications has made a simple book with really good examples and nothing extra is given in this book. I could easily understand the chapters through them. this book has helped me a lot!"

"good book for practice as it lots of M.C.Q s
but there is rarely a question that has a wrong answer, so u might need the help of you teacher (so far found one in chem equilibrium)"
"
 this book is good but not for self study
the questions in the book are excellent
but those solutions might not understand for average students.. 
Overall,This is excellent one from disha.... "
"These are simply superb books! they cover EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND about calculus and give you confidence to write exams especially JEE Main and Advanced"
"MUST BUY FOR IIT ASPIRANTS, FULL OF CONCEPTS, PROBLEMS ARE EASILY EXPLAINED, AND GOOD COLLECTION OF PROBLEMS, HOWEVER ITS A BIT BULKY"
"THE BOOKS ARE COMPLETE PACKAGE FOR STUDENTS DOING SELF STUDY BUT NO SOLUTIONS ARE GIVEN IN THE PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY BOOK"
"solutions are nice.book gives a good preview of questions. 
."
"best for last time self test.. suggest by my elder brother who is doing mbbs from aiims. all previous year question have been categorized topic-wise.. which is best so you test yourself on particular topic...!!! solution are also good and explained well.. only few errors.. which can be ignored..!!"
"
 This kind of book is a must for getting to know the pattern of upcoming CBSE AIPMT.
Without knowing the pattern of previous year test it becomes pretty difficult to prepare for the upcoming test. "
"very useful product. It s worth the price. Its a good gift you can give to your child who is going to give his entrance exam."
"Awesome book with lots of formulas, concepts and exciting chapters I do not recommend this to people with math-o-phobia. Its filled with lots of practice problems from pmt, IIT and 10th boards.if physics is what thrills you and if u feel the soothing pleasure after solving problems, this book is for u."
"The quality of cover and pages of the book were very low and the topics in the book were also not explained properly"
"It explains even the complex topics with great lucidity. A great book to go with if you like studying beyond the scope of your syllabus.( If this book is not available, buy the T.I.M.E as an alternative.)"
"
 this books is very difficult but also very intresting . Filled with a bag of questions and content . This book is not good for starters. It is good for those who have the concept 
 class 11 in class 9 "
"As the title say. This book is not good for 9th only. This book has 11th class concepts.
This book is somewhat tough to solve. We may refer trishna s IIT foundation book instead of this one."
"This is a good set of books that comes in handy for any in-classroom unsolved questions too. However there are several typos and grammatical mistakes that sometimes gets on the nerves of my kid, who is a bit finicky about the language."
"
 Extremely happy to receive the set of books as per standards set by flipkart.
Full transperency and timely delievery.......
The sets of books are clearly few notches above the standard books available in the market.
The only problem is that proof reading is not properly done especially in maths book.
I could find atleast 6 errors in just 1 chapter of maths. 
Overall a great book... A must read for IIT aspirants...... "
"This can be used as good summary of CBSE text book, with MCQ & other questions for competitive exams."
"this book is way better than arihant i would strongly recommend this because u also get papers of aieee/JEE mains paper quality not that bad it compensate for the wrong answers in arihant"
"
 this book is good and has fully solved questions with minimum errors but the only problem is the paper used which is of poor quality.
i suggest arihant past 35 years which is better and cheaper. . . . "
"
 First of all, i would like to tell you that I have really solved parts of the books and not complaining just to make the comment read.
i am not able to see any of the pros in the books.
hence the cons follow:-
1. the paper quality is not adorable
2. the QUESTIONS ARE NOT TYPED CORRECTLY!! i have seen a no. of questions in which the whole diagram has been changed. 
3. In physics, every 1 out of 5 questions gets a mistake, i had been trying the questions , but get confused as to why the answer is not coming(though my conceptual understanding is strong). and at last when i see another book it comes true.
4. the questions are presented in a congested manner.
So now if you want to purchase ,, then you may go ahead.....risk at your own "
"if you are preparing for jee , then previous years papers are a must for you. this book is good , with wonderful alternate solutions( for some problems where possible) , just that the paper quality and binding is not good( but u don t have to keep it in your showcase)."
"This is a best for for all IIT aspirants. It contain past 36 years questions which helps to understand the kind of questions and their level. Its solution also helps alot. It can be used for the judgement of your ability to get through JEE-Advanced."
"it is an good book but if want some key notes and terms than you should once look out for arihant s 35 year .this book only has question rather then any sort of suggestion or tip to how to prepare for iit"
"If you want to crack jee advanced it help to crack it.It contains good material of questions and and paper quality is bit poor GO FOR IT IF YOU WANT TO CRACK JEE"
"These set of books are a must for any IIT aspirant. These books give the questions from previous IIt exams and also contain questions of previous Aieee exams. the solutions are lucid and to the point except at few points, but its worth a buy."
"
 The material is helpful for the exam. 
You can buy this book for your preparation. 
Flipkart rocks :) "
"I buyed it 10 days before the jee mains exam.. it have all those necessary questions of previous years questions which I was needed in my last time for revision.. must have books for jee aspirants.."
"
 this is a nice book for iit aspriants must buy.
paper quality is not good enough but it can be ignored 
most of the solution and answers are perfect there are very less mistake.... "
"This is a good set of solved papers and is free from error. I go at good discount. worth buying. Any one preparing of Jee main and advance, shoul consider this book."
"I m not happy with the questions discussed. There are all repeated, and very few questions discussed. There is no genuinty in the content. Worst printing quality, you can see the smudges of printing of other pages, which makes mess while reading."
"I have been practicing solved papers of past 10 years exam for quite some time now and i wanted a change as in terms of conceptual clarity. this book, topic-wise has made me confident enough with the syllabus and MCQs cover almost all topics. It s good, i must say."
"The service I get from flipkart is fabulous. No any store will give u this service. I get this book 3 days earlier, day after my booking. And the packing is also very very good. No doubt in the book. The clear fresh new original copy of this book I get in so descent price. If you are studying to go in IIT, this book is so important for you. 36 years chapterwise solutions. For study for JEE-ADVANCED. The book and the service that I get from flipkart is fabulous. I love flipkart. I you want to get this book, must get it from flipkart......."
"
 It has all question of iit-jee and jee advance with solution
of last 36 years . the delievry from flipkart was at a time "
"
 This book is awesome and so is MTG. 
I believe that it would be very helpful to have this book always beside you when you are preparing for JEE. So I would suggest to finish a chapter in physics and then immediately solve all the problems in this book and if you do that, JEE would be a piece of cake. "
"
 Timely delivery by flipkart . The book is very much helpful to understand JEE pattern.
Specially chapter wise questions and proper solutions for that is helpful to revise our concepts. "
"The best book one could get at this price!!.MTG has done really a great job compiling the contents of this book.Each and every question has been given an explanation,which makes understanding easy.A really good book!!"
"contains around 10-15 questions(solved) from PCM class 11 and 12 both from the last 12 years 
recommended for those who have no idea of diificulty of JEE main"
"I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO EACH AND EVERY STUDENT. 
COVERS EVERY THING IN SYLLABUS. 
PLEASE BUY SCHAND CONCEPTUAL CHEMISTRY, PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICS & RD SHARMA MATHEMATICS ALONG WITH THIS BOOK FOR BETTER UNDERSTANDING ON THE THEORY PART."
"the book is good but the condition in which it came was very bad because the delivery service in flipkart is not so good and especially for books it come s in a very bad condition, so beware !!!!!!!!!!"
"The book is nice, with appropriate and comprehensive explanations. The model test papers are also a good supplement for revision and practice."
"
 book is too good.. necessary for preparation... 
buy it.. 
with litle errors... "
"I had bought this product and i must say that if u go through it, then it is totally value for money for preparation"
"its extremely helpfull if u want to prepare for aiims, because it hasbexplaination for every question so it is extremely helpfull plus u get a fair idea of what kinda questions are gonna come"
"
 I found this book very useful for me. Students who want to crack AIIMS, please use this book.
Most helpful book. Well service by FLIPCART! 
Thank you! "
"Its a good book for students who have completed their syllabus and are looking for previous years questions. These are my views after using it for 20 days 
pros: 
1)The solutions are in ref to NCERT Books 
2)No repeating of the same question again and again like those in some other books
3)assertion and reason question are well explained 
4)very few mistakes (only printing mistakes)
5)detailed explanation of the zoology answers( some concepts are outside ncert like aiims exams always does please mind only some concepts) 
cons (very few )
1)some printing mistakes (like 3-4 word per 100 pages sor so )
2)some diagrams of organic compounds and coordination compound are incorrect (till now i have found 2 wrong figs) 
overall its a good question bank ,though the paper quality should have been a bit more thick cause they sometimes easily get torn"
"It has clear explanations and good questions.Excellent for practice. Will tell you the rest if I get into AIIMS. :)"
"
 If you are a medical aspirant, then this book is meant completely for you!
You can utilize this book well and you can also buy other entrance materials for AIIMS Medical Entrance exam. "
"
 Mtg provides one of the greatest and accurate solutions. this helped me have an idea of what are the things(syllabus) asked in aiims, it might be a aiims question bank but it really nice for aipmt and state pmt as well. all state and aipmt questions do not go beyond the topics used by aiims to ask questions. 
it increases your level of preparation "
"THE BOOK IS QUIET GOOD FOR MEDICAL STUDENTS...ITS SPECIALTY IS THE DETAILS SOLUTION OF THE MCQ..I LOVE IT..."
"The book is really very much fruitful for the medical entrance examines. I can suggest them,to make a preliminary preparation from this book will may create a sound idea.at last,aawesome book."
"The book is not bad. It wil give an idea of the pattern of the aiims entrance exam. But paper quality is poor."
"This is a must book for all the aspiring candidates of AIIMS exam. You get all the questions yearwise in each chapter along with their detailed solutions. This questions are very often repeated in AIPMT exam also."
"The best feature of this book is that the questions are arranged chapterwise and so the student can ensure he has full grasp on a topic before moving on. It also helps to complete all questions from a particular chapter at one go. 
The explanations are good but I found some to be irrelevant and misleading. The book also has few typo errors. 
Overall I would definitely reccomend!"
"chapter wise questions with explanations are good
it is an excellent practice book
the paper quality of the book should have been a bit more thick..."
"I know tha it s a little too late to buy the book,but it s worth buying its concepts are so easy and thanks to FLIPKART to bring this book before delivery time!!
it s a great deal to read whole book in this 2-3 months....!"
"*Decent for the price.
*Has all the questions in PCM sorted chapterwise.
*Explanations are not that detail, but still satisfactory.
*Despite that content, the book s quite handy.
*No kind of summary or tips for any chapter.
*Its not the book for practice-solving after each chapter.I felt it more useful for last minute revision, kinda like chapterwise mock tests.
In the whole, hmmmm GOOD..."
"Best book for numerical and far better than RC Mukherjee. Contains previous iit problem and objective as well as subjective questions."
"
 contain basic theory plus some ncert and old iit questions
helps to prepare for pmt and i recommend who are weak in basic numericals "
"this book is for those who want to revise all chapters quikly during exam times...not for study ..for revesion one of the best and easy.."
"I bought this for my brother... this book is really awesome.. and the service of flipkart is awesome... it delivered in just 3 days....."
"The book is really good. But their promise of 13 years question paper is fake. It contains only 6 years queating paper of wbjee. So the publication mus look into the matter as soon as possible."
"This book is quite good.. But some questions are quite wrong...And some answers are also wrong... So pls be little conscious while checking ur answers.."
"i had expected the book to contain questions from previous years wbjee but it hardly has 10 problems in the whole book from previous exams. if learning theory is my goal i would go for dcpandey. if practicing is my need i would go for objective physics, aiims chapterwise and aipmt chpterwise explorer all three from mtg. dcp frm arihant thugh"
"
 Really,a great book from MTG catering exclusively to the students of West Bengal.
Nevertheless makes a good read for students aspiring for other entrance exam as well! "
"Awesome for preparing entrance examinations like WBJEE, JEE (Main) And (Advanced). There is however a mistake on the cover. It says 13 years solved papers whereas it only has 6 years!!"
"helpful for wbjee specially because it has all the questions and answers solved in it ..... a handy book indeed ...."
"This book would have been good if it had all the pages...but when you open the book to see that most of the coordinate geometry part is missing then it just doesn t do much other than confuse us...I would suggest sticking to Arihant wbjee..."
"This book provides almost everything you need for West Bengal Joint entrance Examination (Medical). A great synopsis of most of the chapters ensure you do not miss out on any detail. Especially helpful for ISC and CBSE students who (like me) have been preparing for CBSE-NEET."
"this is a great book if u want to score best in WBJEE, the chapterwise questions with a preview of the respective chapter is a cherry on top of a cake.."
"Good Book for last minute revision and chapter wise solving. Theory part given is good. explanations are also good. recommended for Non WB board students specially"
"This book give a rough idea about the question u could expect in wbjee but it s not enough for preparation."
"I being an alumni of IIT, I brought this material for my son. This is a good material for JEE aspirants and it contains detailed explanation of the every chapter. May be few short comings like certain solution answers not being explained properly where they need to focus on in next editions."
"
 this books is very nice and very easy to understand if you are preparing or want to prepare for JEE than this bookset will be helpful.
along with this study package of physics is also good. "
"Think Thrice before you buy this.Bought for my cousin.Theory is somewhat good.Though they say that they have fully solved examples and exercises..Even topics under Inorganic chemistry are included under Physical chemistry without no solution for any excercise question.No exercises are solved in physical chemistry (First 6 booklets).All u hav is Answer key.For the next 6 booklets(organic and Inorganic) they have solved examples and exercises(with detailed solutions)."
"The title is so much deceiving, they have advertised as if you will get everything from KOTA IIT JEE market.....what nonsense publishers are these?
I m completely shocked that only 8-10 questions are discussed in each topic, one must file a case against publisher as well the wrong reviewers. 
Don t take it at even free of cost. I ve thrown it away to scrap market, as flipkart is not allowing refund....."
"Very Good book........
Must for JEE Advanced PHYSICS.........
NEW CONCEPT FROM KOTA S FORMULA TO SUCCESS.........
PRICE IS ALSO NOT MUCH..............
RECOMMEND TO ALL MY FRIENDS...........
Thanks to the publisher."
"Probably i was more ambitious in expecting the excellent quality of book. The book is just good but not excellent as described in the ad."
"Physics booklet has good problems but could have been given much more .,,
and i think mathematics booklets are awesome.,,but the delivery was too late than expected.."
"Guys, this book is good when it comes to MCQs. I loved the book actually, and it covers also the main topics. exams are near and in this short time, i am only trying to solve as much papers as i can, with variety in questions. and I found that in disha publications book. good job!"
"I would recommend this book to all IIT aspirants. clear-cut questions with good MCQs along with solved papers. I have practiced from a few books also, but this book is adding more to my confidence in syllabus. nice work, disha publications."
"This book includes good questions for practice which are actually at jee advanced level.Cutoffs and time limit also tend to be useful and it isn t easy to do these problems"
"

"
 The effort made by the writer can be seen very clearly. The writer explains each topic very clearly and the examples given by him are very helpful. This book is very helpful for competitive exams. Though, there are minor mistakes in the mistakes which I think will be corrected in the second edition of the book. The main strength of this book is the content.
This book helps a person developing logic and improvising on his eidetic memory and his or her creativity. I would recommend to anyone who has a passion for physics "
"If you need clarity in your concepts and don t want to forget any of them in your entire life please read this book. I have been his student and his classes used to be so much fun and at the same time full of learning. He has poured his entire teachings into this book. Must buy for all. 
Eagerly waiting for part 2 for 12th std!"
"A different approach to explain Physics!
A Great Job by Anish Sir ! 
Unfortunately the DVD is not compatible to my MAC and so I am unable to view the lectures if only I have a little help on that it could have been great!
Yet a great job by the author ! 
By the way I did not find the volume 2 ?"
"
 the book which he had written which is called live physics is oriented by its name...what i meant by this is when u will read the book u will feel that a teacher who is sitting besides u and explaining the concepts and theory...so simply..i have buy this book and gaining the profit..it is a well define book with (i think 1000 ) solved examples...and and at the last..it contain the concept applicator by which u can test urself.......
buy it and learn it...!!! "
"live physics by Mr. Anish sir is a best book for compitative examinations .... the book has simple language with detailed explanation ..... the chapters contains conceptwise questions which helps to understand the concept better......... the book starts from basic and ends with advanced level............ :-)"
"Live Physics is really a unique book. It elaborates the theory with examples and hence its very helpful for all as its easy to understand."
"Amazing book with conceptual problems .. the only thing is needed to solve this book, is having your concepts clear and the question are very relevant for competitive exams and this book will definitely sharpens your knowledge of IIT Physics !!!!"
"
 it is a good book and i am satisfied from it.
i am preffering this book for all student prepairing for iit. "
"This book is for developing the basics which further makes easy to solve books like HC Verma, DC Pandey and to some extent Irodov! This book has has clarified my concepts in XI physics and has helped me to gain good marks in my coaching classes!"
"I would like to pay thanks to the author for facilitating us with this unique book..A book which has five sections in increasing order of difficulty levels which changed my perspective of approaching different types of problems..Permutation & combination,once a horror to me has now become a piece of cake of mine. I feel this book will help all JEE entrance aspirants as well as all who wants to learn permutation and combination"
"
 Theory of counting is a complete book for Permutation, Combination & Probability.It emphasis on all the methods to solve the various problems. I could see some techniques which are missing in other books. This book is short and crisp with 5 levels of graded problems.
The best part is all solutions are detailed.
I would recommend all JEE aspirants to buy this books definitely. "
"more focus on problem than the theory and concepts. those who are preparing for iitjee algebra by tewani is better.."
"i have purchased this book for my brother who is preparing for IIT JEE. after two days when i asked my brother about the book he said his teacher too like the book, and prefer to do questions from them...thank u for providing us ma wonderful book."
"this book is good only if you are appearing for Jee Mains and your target is just to solve problems based on formulae 
this book have many conceptual blunders or there are many formulae given coming from no where 
here are some points. which are worthy to read, and you will understand if you are very good student or a teacher for jee and please forgive for bad english :) 
1. in chapter highest power of a number in n! author has explained by taking some examples...but there exist more elegant way to do this (refer bernald child s HIgher algebra 
2. in chapter2. factor theory ...author didnt explain concept of getting odd factors of various type which leaves different type of remainder .for example factor of type 2m+1 , 4m+1 , 4m+3 ...... 
3.in chapter geometrical construction author again didnt explain how to find number of any specific size of rectangle on a random sized rectangle board? he only explained about square board...and that only on chess board . 
4.in chapter circular arrangements author is only limited on basic concepts which are just formulae based 
5.in chapter word formation author gave rank method to count from start no explanation what if a specific word has very large rank, isn t there a short method ? :) 
6.in chapter sum of all number formed no questions on ... what is sum of all numbers when they have 0 and repeated digits?? why?? 
7. in chapter distribution 
(a)for distribution of distinct objects in identical boxes ...there is a formulae given...but that formulae doesn t hold when number of distinct elements are eqaul in atleast 2 identical boxes ? :) 
(b)for distribution of distinct objects in different boxes only direct formulae given no focus on concept of inclusion exclusion coz no one is supposed to remember formuales in PnC 
8 . in chapter number of integral solutions 
 no concept on adding dummy like what a+b+c"
"permutation combination and probability is the toughest of jee maths,this book covers all types of problems on this two topics.various interesting problems and also deeply conceptual."
"HATSOFF... TO THE AUTHOR FOR CREATING SUCH A WONDERFUL BOOK.REALLY ITS AN AWESOME BOOK .LOVED READING IT."

"Good book.Clears concepts."
"the book contains good notes and questions making it valuable for last months revision but not good if you are thinking to do along with your class 11 or 12"
"I m not satisfied with the content provided. There is only one book in the market by BM Sharma and DC Pandey will make you learn physics. All other authors are not efficient in presenting the subject as per the requirement, stay away...."
"Very good book with accurate and simple solutions......the solutions are easy to understand unlike the other books in which the solutions are quite complicated"
"it`s a very good book for chapterwise study of jee main last 10 years questions( not advanced..mind you) all solution are properly given and few steps are jumped..."
