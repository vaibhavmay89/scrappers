This book is argubly the best book in the market if u r looking to crack iit jee just bcoz of the fact that this is the compilation of the best theory out there in physics which explains all the concepts to u in the simplest way possible with the best qns out there given in latest jee main and advanced format. but the only problem i found with this book is the fact that none of the mcqs or exercise problems have solutions and sadly there is no other solution book out there which you could buy.. i have searched all over the internet and in the book stalls but none of them have the solution manual .. so if any of u guys have any idea where i could find the solution manual i would easily give it 5 stars but for now just 3 stars
