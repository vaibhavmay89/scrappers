The book no doubt is good but all that book contains is mere 2 question papers and their answer explanations! With publication year mentioned as 2005 and noted 1st edition, it wasn t that big a heartbreak but the description makes it look like a collection of papers from 2005 onwards . So, please make up your mind before purchasing it as its a 200 page old and detailed guide to COMED-K. I regret this purchase as the I missed the finer prints so I suggest you be judicious!
