this propagates the idea of rote method in organic chemistry.never seen a book of this kind for this good cost.I STRONGLY TELL DON T BUY THIS. it does not give mechanisms for maximum reactions.just waste of money and effort. op tandon has a good publicizing factor which makes this book famous.just try something else
