This is one book which I would recommend to anyone who are looking to have a good understanding of the subject. It is more or like the NCERT class 11 chemistry book, But it has a lot of inclusions from JD.LEE s and SOLOMON and FRYHLE s book. The additional CD is very helpful and the Practice book is more like RANJI SAHI s book. YES, This is a must have resource for any IIT Aspirant.
