 As I said this one of the best mathematics book available for Engineering entrance in India. The book has relevant and quite illustrated Theory ,solved examples are good in quantity as well as quality and problems level are from easy to hard not so challenging problems are included.but the included ones are fair enough to get a handsome rank in jee. Solutions to all problems are given this is quite helpful it makes u realize and compare ur approach towards questions.Previous years questions from major entrances around the country are included.So all is there what a Jee Aspirant needs.
The thing about the book I like is that it has all the formats of questions Jee asks means u will have a good practice on pattern of Jee before the D-Day.
