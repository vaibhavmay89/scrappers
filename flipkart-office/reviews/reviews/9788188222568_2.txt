 The solutions are correct for all the questions i checked but noticed some other problems. 
1.Solutions of 10 questions (chemisty- 2010 q10-20) are missing. 
2.A few answer keys are wrong but their solutions are correct. 
Also 2010 paper was in between the two 2011 papers which kind of give me a headache. 
I just got the book yesterday . All i can say that is that its worth it.
