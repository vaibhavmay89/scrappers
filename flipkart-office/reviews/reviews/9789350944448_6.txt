 definitely a great book for those who want to be good in mechanics. It covers all type of problems and illustrations. you will actually get to know the key trap where students fall in and that often paper setter like to give.
Being good in mechanics will fetch you a decent rank in jee and chapters in this book are the building blocks of important chapters like rotational dynamics. 
I will strongly recommend this book for JEE aspirants.
and FLIPKART rocks!!!!!!!
