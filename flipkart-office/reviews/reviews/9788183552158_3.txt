Simply awesome!...This is one of those books which helps you check your fundamental understanding of physics. You will find variety of problems covering every topic. Most of them are tough but once you solve them you will literally FALL IN LIFE LONG LOVE WITH PHYSICS. Some problems can even take days to solve but what is the fun without that? ..I first came across it during my JEE days and from there I always kept one copy with me. I strongly recommend it to the physics enthusiasts and competitive students. Though current IIT pattern don t require solving such tough problems but it s always good to be a step ahead and have clear understanding of fundas.
