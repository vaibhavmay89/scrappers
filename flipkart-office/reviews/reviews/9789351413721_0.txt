This is good book if you have less time, and more course to complete in 1 to 2 months, (mainly for JMI after waste in JEE Mains)
But I ll I want to tell to Flipkart and to all, that , rate of some books is more on flipkart than Snapdeal, I want to use flipkart due to effective servicing and great experience.
But price matters, so I ll request to flipkart to reduce its price.
(Baki book to bht badiya h bhai ;) )
