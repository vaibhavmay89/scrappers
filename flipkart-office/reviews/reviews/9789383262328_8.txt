The best feature of this book is that the questions are arranged chapterwise and so the student can ensure he has full grasp on a topic before moving on. It also helps to complete all questions from a particular chapter at one go. 
The explanations are good but I found some to be irrelevant and misleading. The book also has few typo errors. 
Overall I would definitely reccomend!
