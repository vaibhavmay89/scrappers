All of this arihant math series are very useful. This book has a lot of information in the specially permutation and combination. It would be better if the proof of the formulas in some chapters were given. But to crack JEE ADVANCE you do not need the proof. You will need those if you love mathematics. Still it is a very good Book for JEE ADVANCE.
