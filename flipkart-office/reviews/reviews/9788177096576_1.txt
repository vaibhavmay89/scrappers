This book covers all the theory (over and above standard 12th class knowledge) required for cracking the engineering competitive exams. The questions are of really high quality. You first need to have solid grasp of basics before attempting this book, as this book takes up the student from the basics to the advanced knowledge, rigor and practice required for engineering exams. This makes a worthy companion to other high quality books published Bharathi Bhawan (HC Verma s Concept of Pysics book, Physics/Chem/Maths MCQ).
