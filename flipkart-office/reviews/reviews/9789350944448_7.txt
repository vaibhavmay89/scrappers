This book in Mechanics is undoubtedly the best in the market. We get exactly what we need for preparing for JEE. 
Theory Has been given perfectly. The language is simple and the author elaborates on the points which are difficult to understand.
The problems are excellent. Most of the problems make you think.
The beauty of the Exercises given is each problem given in them teaches us how to use the concept in a different way.
The bifurcation into JEE main and Advanced makes our preparation even easier.
I strongly recommend buying this book as Mechanics forms a very important part of the JEE syllabus
