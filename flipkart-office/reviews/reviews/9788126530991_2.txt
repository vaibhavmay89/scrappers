This book is an amazing book for Organic Chemistry. I would say that every single mechanism and possible explanation has been given for everything that an IIT aspirant would encounter before the JEE. 
The theory has been supplemented by excellent solved problems as well as additional problems and MCQs of JEE level. The questions make you think and you will find Organic Chemistry much easier with the help of this book. 
This book has exactly what you need for grades 11 and 12, unlike Morrison and Boyd, that has extra topics as well. The questions in that are also not as good as this. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone wanting to master Organic Chemistry.
