Ok this book might be famous amongst the IIT-JEE coaching crowd because it supposedly will make you a master of physics,but then it is not advisable for school students to use this book because it uses concepts much beyond even the JEE syllabus.It could be demoralising,hence a better option would be Resnick-Halliday Indian Edition.
