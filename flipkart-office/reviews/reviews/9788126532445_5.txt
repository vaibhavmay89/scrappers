I use this book to teach my Daughter - Book has good description and is full of excellent examples. Also it takes an algebra based approach which I think makes it ideal for people who don t have background in calculus.
Lot of practical applications are given as well - Book is verbose and it really needs time to read. If you are short of time, use H.C.Verma but if you want to enjoy physics and that too a strong conceptual overview, this book should be on the top of your list. At times I see some definitions to be not very precise but if you read carefully and solve the problems, you will definitely become strong in physics - Instructors who teach may find the book rewarding. Supplementing this book has lot of solutions for NCERT and their objective questions look good though the there are no detailed solutions. 
While the book is expensive, I think it is worth the price and solving all problems can make a person to take state level entrance and AIPMT. For IIT, you are better off with HC Verma with great collection of problems.
