This book is very helpful for those who are preparing for ISI(Indian Statistical Institute) and IIT-JEE and all other national entrance exams... It has good theories and many solved examples... But though there nis some errors in it yet it is very helpful... A living teacher I say... So friends buy it if you really want to learn mathematics and not only doing it... Best of luck for you all :)
