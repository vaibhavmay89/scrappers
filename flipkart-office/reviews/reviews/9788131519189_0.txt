 I bought this book a few days ago and I am seriously glad that I bought it. The book features a very good collection of solved problems and exercises. Moreover the author has taken the pain to highlight important conceptual questions in the exercise to facilitate for easy revision during the last phases of exam preparation. Also, the theory is very well given and easy to grasp and understand. The solutions to the exercises which are given at the end of each chapter are very descriptive and help to any doubts which arise while solving the questions. I am yet to see any thing in this book which I do not like. It is a very good book to build your basic concepts (like GOC, Nomenclature and Isomerism) which are going to be indispensable while solving the chapters ahead (like hydrocarbons, alkyl halides,alcohols,ketones,etc.)
I would recommend this book to every JEE aspirant.
