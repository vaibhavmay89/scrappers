First Solomons himself : Outstanding work . Second : adaptation by MSC : The book is good in explanations where solomons has been written as in original work . Then MSC adds his own stuff from JEE point of view . The added stuff is good content coverage wise but explanation wise its really weak . He has not taken any pains to explain his added stuff on the same level as solomons. This makes the book lopsided . Also some of the concepts added are not needed for JEE but thats alright ; its always good to know a little extra. Final word : Good book for coverage as compared to other similar stuff available in the market . But not self sufficient for self study . Buy it to supplement your studies if you are in a coaching .
