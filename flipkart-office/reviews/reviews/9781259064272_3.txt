it s a very good book to start the preparation for iit jee
though the theory is little less but the large number of solved examples counters it
it covers almost all the topics of iit jee with wide range of previous year questions
but i would suggest to 
DEVELOP BASIC CONCEPTS OF TOPICS BY GOING THROUGH CERTAIN GOOD THEORY BOOKS LIKE R.D. SHARMA OR NCERT BEFORE STARTING McGRAW HILLS.
