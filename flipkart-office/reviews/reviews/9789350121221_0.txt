So, i used this book to prepare for the Indraprastha Uni MCA entrance .... but the paper quality is so bad that it is torturous to read from the book... 
Not to forget that it is replete with mistakes ..... I eventually ended up dumping this book and preparing from another book , made by another publisher.. 
Look around ... there are better options now... 
All the best
