I Had No Book For IIT JEE Organic Chemistry...and Many Of My Friends Had Morrison And Boyd. But This Book is Nicely Crafted For The IIT JEE Pattern.Everything is explained very nicely. The Only -ve Point That I Have Found Till Now, was in The Hyperconjugation topic which said that isobutene is the most stable isomer of butene (i.e. more than trans but-2-ene), which is wrong.(You may check the data in morrison and boyd in heat of hydrogenation table).Otherwise The Book Provides Everything You Need...A very Good Collection Of Questions To Master Your Skiils....One Of The Most Perfect Book Ever !!
