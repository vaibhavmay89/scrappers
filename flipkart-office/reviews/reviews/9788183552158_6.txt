Needless to say this book is the best if you are an IIT aspirant & love problem solving. You must get your concepts cleared before you solve the problems in this book or else you will never get any question right. I ordered this book a week ago. Flipkart should have delivered it by Tuesday 1st July, 2014, but the book has not arrived yet. I have been waiting for it but surprisingly my order gets automatically cancelled & I receive a message from Flipkart about the cancellation of my order. What???!! I haven t cancelled it. Instead I have been waiting for it since a week. I am very disappointed with this carelessness of Flipkart. No reply from the customer service either. Well played Flipkart, not expected from you.
