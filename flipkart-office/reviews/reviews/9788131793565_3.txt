I am not a Chemistry lover, however I found Morrison & Boyd interesting. I used this book in high school for about 50% percent of the Chemistry syllabus in school&JEE related to organic chemistry. The style of the authors was refreshing, and I found it easy to read large sections in short periods. I also found it easy to recall a lot of points as the book was written in such a way as to lead you from one point to the other, which style is the best for organic chemistry.
