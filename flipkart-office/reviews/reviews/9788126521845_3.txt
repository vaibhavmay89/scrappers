Well this is an good book but not that as we need for JEE Advanced. If yo re not that interested in calculus then this is the GOD book for you. But if you want to learn deeply then you must leave this book.In short theory is not good.
By the way questions are too good for practice it contains a great amount of solved example for better understanding. If you just want to learn calculus for JEE then you should go for it.
