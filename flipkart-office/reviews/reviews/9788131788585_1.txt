 I would recommend this book for JEE Main. It has many shortcuts techniques which you will need in exam. It has a adequate number of solved questions and practice questions, and almost every question is new. As you go through the book it will impart confidence in you. But do it after your text book..
I used this book and got 115/120 in Maths in JEE Main 2013
