Awesome book with lots of formulas, concepts and exciting chapters I do not recommend this to people with math-o-phobia. Its filled with lots of practice problems from pmt, IIT and 10th boards.if physics is what thrills you and if u feel the soothing pleasure after solving problems, this book is for u.
