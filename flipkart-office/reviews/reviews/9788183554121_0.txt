 If you are preparing for an entrance exam like SAT or JEE (Advance) and have already completed Irodov and HCV and all other sorts of books and papers.....and are looking for a book that provides you the toughest problems for the final revisions, then this book is for you.
Dont buy this if you are preparing for MAINS or any other exams. This contains 4 topics, namely mechanics, heat & molecular physics, optics and electromagnetism which are toughest topics in physics. The best part are the solutions. The numerical aspect is good, but the detailed imaginative way of answering has made this book a final and ultimate refer guide. If you solve all 200 questions of it, i can bet you will get through any physics olympiad or exam.
Cheers !!!!!
