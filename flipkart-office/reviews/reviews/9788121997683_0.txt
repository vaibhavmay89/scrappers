Only previous GATE & IES solved questions are given with definitions of some important concepts. 
But Operations Research & Industrial Engineering are just ignored . 
Very few material on such topics. 
If you already have R K Rajput books on each subject then NO NEED TO BUY this one,
since concepts are just copied pasted as they are.
