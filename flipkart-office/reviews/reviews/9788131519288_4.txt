Good book for IITJEE preparations. Not very tough, not trivial, but at the right level of 16/17 year old brain. There are about 16 books in this IITJEE-advanced preparations (Maths, physics, Chem). Good to have all of them at home and start preparing in synchronization with school teaching. All the best.
