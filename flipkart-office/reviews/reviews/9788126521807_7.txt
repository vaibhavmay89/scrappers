This is a very good for the purpose of IIT JEE. But one needs to have a good knowledge of the NCERT text before jumping on to this book. Except the electron potential diagrams everything suites me. It unravels many facts that r not present in the NCERT. A must book for IIT JEE. My suggestion : Please read the preface and note to students before reading the text.
