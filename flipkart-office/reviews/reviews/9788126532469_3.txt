Pros: 1 good matter for organic and inorganic 
 2. Work Book Is helpful 
Cons: 1.Very Bad content for physical/general chemistry 
 2.Although the book says : A Must-Have Resource Book JEE Topics related to competition are not explained .And in some chapters it does not focuses on competition. 
 3.Bad theory (infact NCERT is better than it) 
My Opinion : it has really bad theory 
cd is of no use.
Don t go for it , try pradeep s
