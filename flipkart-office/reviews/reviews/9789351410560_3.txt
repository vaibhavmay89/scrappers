First of all, reviewing the book from Arihant. This book is good for practice. 
It has got tooo many mistakes in it(Arihant is famous for mistakes). 
First go through a chapter s preview that is available on arihant s website.
Important chapters have more no. of questions for practice. I bought this book mainly for practice purpose, i.e just for question solving, and it does fulfill my needs. I got through many of the mistakes till now and students with decent knowledge will realize the 
mistakes.
