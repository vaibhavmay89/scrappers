 EXCELLENT! I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY SON AND WONDER IF WE WOULD HAVE THESE SORT OF BOOKS AT OUR TIME! EXTREMELY PROFESSIONAL APPROACH! NO NEED TO TAKE HELP FROM OTHERS! IF ONE IS SINCERE AND HONEST, THEN CAN TAKE OUT MAXIMUM OUTPUT! 
ANXIOUSLY WAITING FOR THE CLASS - 9 BOXSET. 
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, PAPER QUALITY IS NOT GOOD AS WELL AS THE CD QUALITY. ILLUSTRATIONS ON BOARD ARE NOT AT ALL VISIBLE!
