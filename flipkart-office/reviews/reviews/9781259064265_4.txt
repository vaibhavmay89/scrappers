From its Physics and mathematics counterpart this book seems lacking at first sight in terms of chapter outline , solution quality , theory given . 
As one gets going reading chapters we find ourselves very much through it and when you forget comparison you find that this is what we expect from a book but we do expect a better one from TMH. 
A sure buy for students expecting top ranks.
