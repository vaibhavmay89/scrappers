 Lots of quality objective questions,fill in the blanks, matching type questions etc. with answers. But solutions of a very few questions are given in this book, so that is a shortcoming that I felt. Regardless it is a good book for preparation. 
If you are thinking of buying it and Go for it!!. It is one of the best books available in the market for Competitions.
