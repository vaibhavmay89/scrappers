This is just a REVISION book, not full-length study material.
Formulas are given without derivations, imp. results arrived at just the same way. But the problems cover a wide variety of situations. The number of such problems is however oddly low. Some of the questions are from previous IIT question papers and Olympiads (a few).
Small and just about the right size for comprehensive revision.
But if you want more practice, better go for Arihant s A problem book in Chemistry or TMH s Comprehensive chemistry for JEE advanced .
