I dont say it is a total waste but to a limit it is.They donot have solutions except for JEE advenced subjective questions.And every chapter contains nearly 100 qusetions out of which there are 10-15 Jee Advanced subjective questions.Also they have only 10-18 solved Illustrative examples of which most of them are not so tough.All books in this series are of same condition including Mechanics II,Waves & Thermodynamics,Electricity and Magnetism,Optics and Modern Physics and this one.Just think before you buy.Sometimes you feel different & sometimes you feel the same as Me.
