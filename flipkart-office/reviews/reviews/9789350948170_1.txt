 The book is best if you know every holy shit and then go for the sums, for a class 11 student, if you study n finish a single chapter and then go for this book to solve question from the same chapter, it will not be ideal for you!
there is absolutely no emphasis on basics or concept building, just some formulas are presented at the beginning of each Chapter and then you are asked to solve!
But the systematic Approach is phenomenal and the solutions provided is pin point and worthy of appreciation.
