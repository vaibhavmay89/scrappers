This book is too small, but still you can read it like a story book for primary school students. Things are just brief, just to brush up your memory. Size is just 8 X 5 , with 240+ pages, but don\ t expect much as the characters are large. Still you can have this. This will be the best use for people like me who have completed their degree and doing job, but still desperate to remember the things at least in periphery, they studied.
