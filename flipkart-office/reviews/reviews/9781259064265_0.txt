nice book... gives the complete idea of the pattern of jee advance paper(iit jee).... covers all types of questions single choice, multiple choice, comprehension type, assertion type, matrix type and even subjective questions... good and quality questions... intro of each and every topic given in the beginning... not waste time like other jee books
