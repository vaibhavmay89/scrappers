I found this book to be written in very simple and clear language. It takes us from basic to the highest level.Concepts are explained very nicely and i think unnecessary things are not there.But my advice would be to first study ncert properly and then go for this .Although this book takes us to the highest leve but i think some of the topics like nomenclature are not up to the mark.But it is a lot better than morrison and boyed and other books.You must go for this one.
