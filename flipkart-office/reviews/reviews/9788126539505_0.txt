Pros - 
Firstly, this book is awsome ! It has deepest theory and every detail of it is presented in a great manner. Furthurmore, it has many solved examples after every single topic which makes it easier to understand.
How many of you had trouble learning IONIC EQUILIBRIUM or REDOX REACTION ?? I did. I searched many books to find good text on these topics.... And i did found them.... But this book is above them all. Previous years questions of examinations have also been added .
Cons -
There are few cons.... The major one being poor quality of answers to the questions. DONT refer this book for questions (until you have too much time) . RC MUKHERJEE was and still is the best book for attempting problems and practicing them.
Final Word-
1. Read theory from this book.
2. Solve RC Mukherjee.
3. Solve questions of your coaching classes.
4. Solve previous years exams questions.
You will crack any competitive exam ! :)
