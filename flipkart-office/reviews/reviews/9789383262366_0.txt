*Decent for the price.
*Has all the questions in PCM sorted chapterwise.
*Explanations are not that detail, but still satisfactory.
*Despite that content, the book s quite handy.
*No kind of summary or tips for any chapter.
*Its not the book for practice-solving after each chapter.I felt it more useful for last minute revision, kinda like chapterwise mock tests.
In the whole, hmmmm GOOD...
