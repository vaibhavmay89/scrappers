As I was preparing for my medical examination, I had no idea about complex Maths in Physics. Mathematical Tool was the first chapter in class XI (phy) and my NCERT book was not enough to completely understand the above chapter. This book was of tremendous help! All topics in an elaborated format without any complex concept as used in a PROPER maths book!! JUST TO UNDERSTAND FEW CONCEPTS OF MATHS USED IN PHYSICS!
