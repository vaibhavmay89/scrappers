Its the classic case of old wine in new bottle . The book is just the normal carey otherwise available without this packaging . Shishir Mittal has just added some questions at end of each chapter with answer keys ( no solutions ) . I couldnt find anything else that makes it the book for IITJEE anymore than it originally was . So good book by carey , OK additions of questions by SM (and good use of his name in kota to push this book by SM) . Your call to go for it or not .
