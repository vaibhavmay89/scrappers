This book is for concepts of Organic Chemistry, uptill now it has been a problem with foreign writer s books that questions are not included or if included they are insufficient for Entrance Exams in India but this book comes with a solution, since it is adapted by M.S. Chauhan, it has ample amount of questions, also content of the book is relevant for JEE, not included those parts which are irrelevant for JEE. 
 Also pages of book and text of the book make you fall in love with Organic and you won t feel like those foreign writer s book which are actually Xerox type (made for subcontinent students only, also cheaper than the original one).
