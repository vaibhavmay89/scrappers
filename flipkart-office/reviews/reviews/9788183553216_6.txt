this book is good to learn and revise the formula-es which can be used to solve the questions mostly asked in school level examinations but this book lacks some topics and points which are mostly required for competitive examinations...although this book mentions that it is useful for entrances but u can t get all.... at last.. u can use this to learn basic formulas if u don t like to study big big volumes and to revise at the last moment :)
