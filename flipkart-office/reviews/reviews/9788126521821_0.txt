this book is a great book the one who has preferred das gupta s book might find some similarity in this book but yes it is based upon the latest iit jee pattern also it focuses on the latest exam ISEET which can be a reason to call it one of the greatest book in algebra. Permutations and combination, matrices and det are the best part in it.
