For starters this book is well written and finely conceived. But it has been published taking into mind the Class 11 entrants. So if yo re in 12th or even Half past 11th, It might not prove itself so useful. The writers have an amateur writing style. However, it does give you a few insights on how to prepare yourself- on a self disciplined principle- not getting into the IIT. 
Flipkart s delivery was a dismay this time- They usually deliver books in 36 hours in Kolkata.. This one took 72. 
3.7 Stars would be apt for the piece. (Not considering Flipkart s delivery standards)
