I ve gone through the book. Synopsis is nicely given, points are not elaborated. It s useful only for quick revision. Only few solved examples are given. A lot of problems are left to reader, students should never buy such stupid book. Overall it s worst book for preperation. Don t really know where did the author put his 20 years teaching experience.
