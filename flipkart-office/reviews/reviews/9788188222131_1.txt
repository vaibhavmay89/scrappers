Like any other DC PANDEY series book....this book is brilliantly written,contains best problem collections. One should solve all problems of this book...but before books like HC VERMA sholud be solved...those who don t want 5 different semi complete books for JEE should go for Krishnas IIT Physics..as it starts with the most basic level. Arihant books should be solved by coaching/tuition/etc students.Overall MUST BUY! It is a good topic to score in JEE/AIEEE/JEE mains....and SLEE
