 WELL I SIMPLY DIDNT LIKE THE BOOK THE NO. OF SOLVED EXAMPLES R MUCH MORE THAN THE NUMBER OF PROBLEMS 
THE AUTHOR HAS FOCUSED MORE ON PROBLEMS WHICH ALREADY CAME IN IIT JEE RATHER THAN CREATING HIS OWN PROBLEMS THERE R A FEW ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS WHICH R NOT SO GUD(THOUGH CHALLENGING I MUST SAY) THE AUTHOR HAS NOT WRITTEN THIS BOOK IN A VERY SYSTEMATIC WAY
