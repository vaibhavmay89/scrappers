This book and other in this series(maths,chem)are just waste of your money.This book contains only 50-65%(approx)of the previous years jee questions and you are devoid of many good questions.Those who recommend this book are in illusion.If you don t believe compare it with the MTG book.
So better go for the MTG publication at least in this case
