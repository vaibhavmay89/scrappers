 I liked this book due to its simplicity and comprehensivenes in explaining the concepts necessary from ground up. All basics before starting the periodic table are provided in the book. I liked two aspects much 1) work book excersices here and there for all intermdiary of chapters and 2) practical application examples as i saw in most costly foreign author chemistry books.
I give 4 stars instead of 5 only due to the lack of advanced coverage still more. But those stuffs and advanced treatment may not be much available in indian autor books, but i saw some in JD Lee and Cottons Basic & Advanced Inorganic chemistry.
Overall it is a very excellent effort from author Dr. R K Gupta.
Alcohol meter (breathalyzer) application logic using K2Cr2O7 and ethanol is excellent as provided in example excercises.
For IIT, advanced engg. college entrances and AIIMS/advanced medical entrance aspirants will find this most useful. The autor gives priority in explaining to dull/average student in his entire book coverage than for most brilliant one.
But for chemistry lovers like me, i expect coordination chemistry still more advanced and in fact this topic is much sought after in IIT entrances. 
I promise anybody will love to read this book and the well graded excercises.
