 This book is excellent. The questions are toughest.. If one solve its problems, he has a good chance in IIT exam.. But one must have thorough knowledge of basic physics and knowledge of inegration and differentiation.. The language is bit difficult and symbols used are not standard actually.. So I had some problems in starting.
But its a great book.
