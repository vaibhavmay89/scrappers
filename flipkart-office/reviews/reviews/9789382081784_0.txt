-I found this book pretty sufficient. 
-It has papers from 2002-2012 but each paper has atleast 2 mistakes in its answer key. 
-2011 (Reshceduled) paper had more than 33% incorrect answers in answer key. Although the solutions had the corrections so no worry.
-The 5 mock tests at the end are good but at a higher level than JEE Main.
-Worth a buy for the previous years papers if you didn t find anything else.
