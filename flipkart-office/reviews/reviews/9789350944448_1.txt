The book does not clear basic concepts...it touches them..but you wont understand it thoroughly after going through the book...there are standard and tough problems...but exercises could have been graded better..like u need knowledge of later chapters for solving questions from an earlier one...some problems are over the top n not needed for JEE...buy dis if u are good in phys...this book wont improve understanding of the topic
