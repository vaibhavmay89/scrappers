TBH, This book is worthless. Stay Away. 
Theory: No use buying this book for even short summary of theory. The book misses out lots of important points in the theory. Even important chapters have very little theory (only about 4-5 pages). 
Questions: No use buying it for the questions either. Hardly 100 questions in each chapter. Soultions are provided to only 30% of the questions. The CD has the same questions that are in the book. CD is useless as well. Has a lame interface. 
*Not at all worth the price tag.*
