 Good book with excellent graded problems. Theory is straight forward as they mention. At least some very little basic chemistry understanding is needed for succesfully reading this book. Whatever the reason, i liked this book unconditionally. It should be useful compared to other books available in market. 
I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 so that author can remove errors in few worked out problems (e.g. a problem following very lengthy one in first chapter.) and i hope this point i mentioned doesnt under estimate the whole value of book. New author Ranjeet Shahi is my favourite author after i bought this one. Soon, i will buy Essentials of Organic chemistry by same author and give my feedback.
