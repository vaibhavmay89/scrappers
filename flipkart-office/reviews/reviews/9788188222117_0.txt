Guys to be true.Look This books problems are good but solutions are not upto the mark. The book has a wide assortment of problems but when u solve them and u see the answers are not matching but your answer is dimensionally correct then that is a printing mistakes. And you won t be satisfied with just one , you will get many. So don t look at the answers and solutions at the back. just don t get irritated. Its better you solve hc verma and your school text book and then attempt this book on any chapter. Nevertheless a good book !
