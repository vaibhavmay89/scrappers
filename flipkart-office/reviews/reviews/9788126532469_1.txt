I really appreciate the way, basics are explained with lots of solved example in this book. Though costly, I was a bit apprehensive about its content, but after going through pages, I found it worth buying. As a parent, I feel this book has really made chemistry as easy as ABC, with facts explained in simple language. I recommend it for all serious students preparing for competitive exams as well as for those desirous of a conceptual knowledge in Chemistry for the course work.
