Ok, basically no single book about gd or PI would satisfy my hunger so I got three (two from my friends- a good combo.) This 1 s more like a key to provide u quick answers to all topics n yes, it has lots of topics! u read it n u can say somethin about anything... Another 1 I have has more of mock gds but few topics, while 3rd, the cheapest 1 is totally useless. I m convinced no book, Indian or International can be a complete book on gd, there4 I ll advice u all to read from more than 1. And don t 4get to surf net for good stuff n videos! Better b careful than lose a seat, no? Gotta study 4 CAT also! Tc!
