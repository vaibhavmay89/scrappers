the book is really good for those who have keen interest or curiosity to solve problems in calculus.it s not n exam prep. book but can be beneficial to u if you have passion to study the subject.may be it can be useful in various olympiads.however being a +2 student i can say that the whole book is not meant for +2 students but again it s good for higher studies.the only problem with the book is that it does not contain any text for pre-reading for that u have to refer mathematical analysis by af bermant.
thumbs up to flipkart for fast delivery of book.
