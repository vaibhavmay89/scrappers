This book is very well written and explains all the concepts properly.Great work done by the author to help the students prepare for the entrance exams.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand mechanics in depth.Even a tough topic like rotational mechanics is dealt with brilliantly and gives the student confidence to perform in the exam.
