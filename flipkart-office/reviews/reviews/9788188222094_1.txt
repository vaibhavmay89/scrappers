It s one of those books that are difficult to describe or rate. Rather a paradox. On the question side fair, but on the solution side, niggardly. Can t settle on the question of the audience: who is it for? - the IIT aspirants or the IITians. Except for level two questions no solutions or even hints are available. So unless there s a strong guide to fall back upon, the book can be quite exasperating. I d rather the author had gone for a few more pages even at the risk of increasing the price a bit, say another twenty five of forty five rupees.
