 I had thought this book would be a nice theory book but after using this I have concluded that this book(actually whole series of TMH Comprehensive) is not for learning theory. These books would be helpful only when you have some 3-4 months before jee and you need quick revision and a lot of numericals.
For e.g some important formulas have not been given in Atomic Structure chapter of this book.
