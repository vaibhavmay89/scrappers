It is a really good book to study coordinate geometry from. 
Pros:
Really good theory 
Examples and theorems are done usually by more than one method
If u sit down, try to prove theorems yourself,do the examples your concept will be concrete 
there is a little more than in IIT syllabus but no complaints as it is just dealing with various types of problems like line mirror(based on application of concepts in syllabus) that can definetley come for exams. 
Cons 
not too many practice problems. For that you need ML Khanna
