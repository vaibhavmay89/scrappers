 I expected more about this book 
I disappointed after I bought
but some concepts surface chemistry,electro chemistry are good 
Chemical kinetics is too worst in this book
Mole concept is explained in very good level ... 
so on average this is not bad book but some concepts like chemical kinetics are too bad...
