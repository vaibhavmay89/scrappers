 The effort made by the writer can be seen very clearly. The writer explains each topic very clearly and the examples given by him are very helpful. This book is very helpful for competitive exams. Though, there are minor mistakes in the mistakes which I think will be corrected in the second edition of the book. The main strength of this book is the content.
This book helps a person developing logic and improvising on his eidetic memory and his or her creativity. I would recommend to anyone who has a passion for physics
