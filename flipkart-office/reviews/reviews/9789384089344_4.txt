this book is good only if you are appearing for Jee Mains and your target is just to solve problems based on formulae 
this book have many conceptual blunders or there are many formulae given coming from no where 
here are some points. which are worthy to read, and you will understand if you are very good student or a teacher for jee and please forgive for bad english :) 
1. in chapter highest power of a number in n! author has explained by taking some examples...but there exist more elegant way to do this (refer bernald child s HIgher algebra 
2. in chapter2. factor theory ...author didnt explain concept of getting odd factors of various type which leaves different type of remainder .for example factor of type 2m+1 , 4m+1 , 4m+3 ...... 
3.in chapter geometrical construction author again didnt explain how to find number of any specific size of rectangle on a random sized rectangle board? he only explained about square board...and that only on chess board . 
4.in chapter circular arrangements author is only limited on basic concepts which are just formulae based 
5.in chapter word formation author gave rank method to count from start no explanation what if a specific word has very large rank, isn t there a short method ? :) 
6.in chapter sum of all number formed no questions on ... what is sum of all numbers when they have 0 and repeated digits?? why?? 
7. in chapter distribution 
(a)for distribution of distinct objects in identical boxes ...there is a formulae given...but that formulae doesn t hold when number of distinct elements are eqaul in atleast 2 identical boxes ? :) 
(b)for distribution of distinct objects in different boxes only direct formulae given no focus on concept of inclusion exclusion coz no one is supposed to remember formuales in PnC 
8 . in chapter number of integral solutions 
 no concept on adding dummy like what a+b+c
