I think this is the best book which cope with the demands of jee candidates. The chapters are given in an organized way in which a jee aspirants should study. Excellent dealing of theory with lot of questions to practice. Plz don\ t think much and have it if you want to become master in organic. I have also gone through Solomons and Morrison&Boyd but those books didn\ t dealt with chapters in JEE manner . Therefore I strongly recommend this book for all jee aspirants.
