Graham Solomon and Fryhle have put a lot of efforts to prove that their book is the best in the market currently. 
For all those who are IIT-JEE Aspirants, this book is a must buy to understand every concept easily. It contains a lot of information which is more than sufficient who wants to get a good rank JEE-Main or Advanced.
Although I would recommend other books for solving problems of Organic Chemistry. I would recommend Himanshu Pandey s Organic Chemistry book.
