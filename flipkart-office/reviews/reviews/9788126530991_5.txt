Really nice handling by flipkart.
I bought the original graham solomones,which was itself great.but this book has shaped it to cater for iitjee and others exams needs.some examples oriented for the exams have been added in every topic,and solved & unsolved JEE type questions have been in added in a good number,apart from the problems that originally existed.Theory is very nice,especially for chemistry haters,credits to graham ans solomons.MS Chouhan has done an awesome job in editing.highly Recommended for all 11th-12th class students.
