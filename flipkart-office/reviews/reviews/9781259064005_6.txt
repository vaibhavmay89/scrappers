Excellent book for practice, but not for theory!!
I bought this from flipkart as it was suggested by our coaching institute and flipkart is the best!! 
Pros 
1. Contains a lot of questions from nearly all the topics for jee main.
2. Detailed explanations of answers are given. 
3. Very easy to understand the answer.
4. Different level questions are given. 
Cons 
1. It is not meant for theory. 
2. Some topics like linear inequalities are not given. 
Would like to recommend to al the aspirants for jee main. But make sure you read theory from some other good book before attempting it!!!
