I am a XIth standard student and I aspire to clear IITJEE and AIEEE. I came to know that DC PANDEY is a very good author of COMPETITIVE EXAMS Books. So I bought this book. I was not clear about a lot of topics and now I am now 99% confident about the chapters I read.This also has a lot of questions. And also seperate parts, AIEEE corner and IITJEE corner. Although I found some flaws that some topics are not even touched(i dont mean that anything from the IITJEE syllabus but some topics that are needed to understand those) otherwise I think this is a very good book and I will buy the other parts also. :-)
