The book is helpful as the last edition of AA and MK does not include these question paper.
But the 1 thing that need to be improved is that the answers of all Qs of all papers are jumbled up in subjectwise format. It is very difficult to find answer in the order of flow of questions.., otherwise it might be helpful as it given in subject wise manner so that all Qs related to a particular subject can be read and understood in better way.
