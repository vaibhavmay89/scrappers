Avoid buying any of this author s books. I am one disgruntled student who ended up purchasing his Internet Marketing by Prof Mukesh Bhatia . 
The book is nothing but a concoction of all material which is plagiarised (directly copied over) from the internet, websites like wikipedia and the likes, with not even the courtesy of quoting them. Word to word material copy pasted and presented as his own. The self proclaimed MBA who has tought 50,000 plus students as per his introduction, is nothing but a fake.
