Not bad but too precise. If you want to somehow pass the entrance test this book is OK otherwise not too much helpful. Not for higher rank holders in NEET-UG. This book can never be a best seller as other medical entrance books of Disha. Infact other publications are far better but if you look at the positive side, its a good book for amateurs. 
One of the greatest backdrop of this book is that questions are not of that high standard that is as of the exam. Price of the book is suited to its quality.
