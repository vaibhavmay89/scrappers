hi students! I suggest u all not to buy this book . Initially , this book appears to be highly useful but once u take the course harder u will face chapters such as aldehydes and ketones, alkyl halides , acid derivatives , etc. , the author hasn t given us the entire theory !!!!! instead , i suggest u to buy organic chemistry by k s verma . its the best book in the market for iitjee organic chem . TRUST ME coz i m victim of this book :-(
