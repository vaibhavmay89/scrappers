The best inorganic chemistry book for iitjee. Medical aspirants can also buy this book. Though the best part of this series is Organic Chemistry by Solomons and Fryhle. For best result one should buy this edition along with the original edition. Contains lot of interesting topics that are not included in other inorganic chemistry books. For all iit aspirants I would suggest them to buy all the three books of maestro series.(i.e- J D Lee, Solomons and Fryhle and the physical chemistry book by some unknown author.
