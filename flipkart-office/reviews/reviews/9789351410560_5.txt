This book is awesome.It tells all about what you want to study and what not on the basis of previous 5 years. and it also tells what percentile comes from 11th an 12th and topic wise questions which came in previous years. Only one regret and that is it has a limited theory only for them those who already know every thing. But again its a crash course. So i say go for it.................
