A good book covering the theory in details. Perhaps the best Physical Chemistry book for iitjee. It contains lot of solved out problems asked in iitjee and aieee. Exercises at the end of chapters are also very useful. It contains some important topics which are not included in other iitjee books. The only drawback is lack of new of problems.
