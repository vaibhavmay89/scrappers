This book covers almost all topics which are usually asked in the IITJEEs. But you will not find sufficient theory in this book which one has to be familiar with in order to solve the problems. At the beginning of each and every chapter, the book supplies us with Recap of Necessary Facts and Formulae . The results mentioned here are, no doubt, highly conceptual..but it will be extremely difficult for the student to derive those results themselves. If you are familiar with all those results and hunting for challenging problems like those asked in IITJEE, this book is a must for you. Containing above 3000 problems, this book covers a wide range of problems ranging from easy to challenging. Unlike the MCQ book of ADG, none of the problems are provided with an explanatory solution, merely the answer is given. In a nutshell, if you are an expert...this book is a must but if you are a beginner, this book will be of no help to you !
