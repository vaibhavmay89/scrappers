the name arihant attached itself implies that the book was of good quality, but i was worried whether it would serve my purpose for competitive exams in india,as they lay a great emphasis on maths...i got the book and although i dont every part of it,i have realised that maths could be done in alternate ways in very swift and fast methods with using graphs...i like the book
