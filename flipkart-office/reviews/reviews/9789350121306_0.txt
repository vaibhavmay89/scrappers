 I used this book. It has a good collection of solved previous papers.
It will give you a good idea about the difficulty level of the paper.Which topics are regular, which are given more weight-age.
how to tackle high difficulty questions with shortcuts for MCQs. 
only defect is that the practice papers had a few out of current syllabus questions which you can ignore. 
I am a qualified candidate of JAM 2012 Mathematics.
best of luck to you!
