FIRST OF ALL THANKS FLIPKART FOR ITS AMAZIN SERVICES!
THIS BOOK IS NICE ATTRACTIVE AND DIGS UP RIGHT TO BUILD YOUR BASE AND CONCEPTS FOR IITJEE. ONLY ONE THING BAD ABOUT THIS IS THAT THE TEXT IS TOO LENGHTY AND U HAVE TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME TO READ IT! SOMETIMES IT BORES U.THE PRACTICE BOK QUESTIONS ARE OF A GOOD LEVEL, BUT MANY QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM P RADEEP
BUT IF ONE READS IT PROPERLY BY HEART U WILL FEEL CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO FACE QUESTIONS.
