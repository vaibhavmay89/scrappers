Its a good book for students who have completed their syllabus and are looking for previous years questions. These are my views after using it for 20 days 
pros: 
1)The solutions are in ref to NCERT Books 
2)No repeating of the same question again and again like those in some other books
3)assertion and reason question are well explained 
4)very few mistakes (only printing mistakes)
5)detailed explanation of the zoology answers( some concepts are outside ncert like aiims exams always does please mind only some concepts) 
cons (very few )
1)some printing mistakes (like 3-4 word per 100 pages sor so )
2)some diagrams of organic compounds and coordination compound are incorrect (till now i have found 2 wrong figs) 
overall its a good question bank ,though the paper quality should have been a bit more thick cause they sometimes easily get torn
