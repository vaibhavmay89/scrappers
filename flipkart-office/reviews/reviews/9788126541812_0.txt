The book is great to study organic chemistry but requires you to have atleast some basic knowledge of the subject..
Pros..
1. Includes all required reaction mechanisms to understand better -an edge over books books like Arihant Organic Chemistry by RK Gupta 
2. Stereochemistry(and explanation with structures) is just mind blowing.
3.A lot of irrelevant parts(wrt IIT JEE) has been removed.
4. Exercises and intext questions are far better than Indian writers
5. Good explanations.
Cons..
1. As the book is an adaptive version of the original Original Chemistry By Solomons & Fryhle a lot of good illustrations have also been removed in order to make it compact.
2. Two chapters that have been added at the end of the book are not so good.
3. It requires a pre-knowledge of the subject else you will be stuck many a times.
Overall, the book has some problems but is good enough to prepare you well for competitive exams.
