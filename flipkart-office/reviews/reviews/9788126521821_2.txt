The book builds its theory and sets the pace nicely. The problems are structured in order to facilitate a student to learn the content from scratch. Unlike TMH s classic (which is good to solve when you have learn t everything), this book and all other books in this series build gradually, to bring the student to IIT standard. If you are a serious aspirant and require a perspective over some concepts, this is a neat presentation to follow. Altogether, its worth its cost. Thanks to the authors for the nice work.
