Well , I brought this book with lot of expectation . But it couldn t fulfill it. Though the problems may be good but not of that standard everybody expects from Russia. If your concepts are clear it would take some few days to solve it , so not useful for them .It may be good for beginners.(9th standard)
Also many important topics like graph , Mean-Value theorem , Rolle s Theorem etc are missing from this book . 
Overall , satisfactory .But not a Classic Russian book everybody expects.
