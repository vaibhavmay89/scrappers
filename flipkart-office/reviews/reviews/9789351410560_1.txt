 
Best book for JEE main. help in advance also.
The book is very good for jee main preparation. Theory is given in brief. Best way to have a revision of old lessons but useful to set them on my mind in little time 
Pros:
1) problems at the end of every day makes the lesson good and help to judge how the preparation is.
2) The problems are very related to JEE main syllabus and explanation is good enough. 
Cons:
Not a good choice for JEE advance but it can help for advance level also. 
A good piece from the house of Arihant.
