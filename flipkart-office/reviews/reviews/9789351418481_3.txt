Pros : 1. Covers the whole sylabbus.
 2. Bridges the gap between the concept in the textbook to examination problems.
 Hence, it has the two most important characteristic we look for in a book.
Cons : Frankly , I can t think of anything
So overall if you cover the book sincerely and do all the problems, I think calculus will become a piece of cake for you.
