 PROBLEMS IN MATHEMATICS is a great book for maths.
the questions in this book hit directly on your concepts. By its size , it may look as a small book, but be prepared to face some boggling questions just as u open this book. 
also, i would like to suggest u to buy this books from flipkart. the delivery speed and the book condition is just impeccable.
