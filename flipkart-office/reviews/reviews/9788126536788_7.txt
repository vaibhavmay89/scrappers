This book is very good. The concepts are completely picked from Haliday,Resnick,Walker extended edition and copied in this book which makes it a very good book or simply the best book for concepts but still it lacks solutions to exercises which should have been provided.
I will suggest others not to buy this book but buy Haliday,Resnick Walker 9th edition fundamentals of physics and H.C.Verma for numericals.
If you want all 3 things-solutions,concepts and numericals then go for CENGAGE publishers.
But still this book is great for theory and questions. Only problem it doesn t contain solutions so think once before you buy.
