complete waste of money.. not very impressive.. there are other better books like arihant. tata mcgrow..for Jee ( Mains & Advanced ) in this book single option and more than one option questions are mixed up.. very difficult to differentiate.. answer keys are just given .. exercise is totally unsolved... ..there are few solved scattered descriptive problem which you often get in standard books.. no theory is discussed.....please do not buy the book.. service and delivery of flipkart was good as always.
