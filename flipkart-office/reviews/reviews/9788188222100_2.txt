this is a very good book that has been very useful for my IIT preparation . even my teachers recommend the solving of this book on a day to day basis. the book courses saliently through the most important topics in physics: rotational and fluid mechanics. a good way to be confident of an IIT rank is by solving atleast 5 sums from each of the AIEEE and IIT corners of each books.it is a must have book for every IIT aspirant!!
