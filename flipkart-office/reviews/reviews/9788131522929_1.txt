When G. Tewani and Cengage publication meets, what we get is this awesome calculus book. The main feature of the book is its precise theory with deep explanation of concepts & lots of question practice, includes graphical as well as basic approach, solutions are with deep explanation, concept application exercise keeps the track of solid learning. All NCERT questions are included, so you need not buy a RD Sharma for boards. However, Exercise questions may sometime seem too difficult or the solution mind-boggling, and such a large number of questions may prove to be useless as it takes too much time. So buy it if you target JEE Advance or if you want to learn mathematics at higher level. Keep practicing throughout the year and this book will become the best of your companion for the year.....
