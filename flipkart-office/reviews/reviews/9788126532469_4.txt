i bought this book in around april this year,and red most of it,it s one of the most wonderful book one can ever read,the coloured illustration is awesome,the book is divided into 2 parts,1st part has theory and some questions(around 50 per chapter),2nd part is full of questions for both board exams and competitions.
Theory has been explained very well,the cd is also good.If comparing to pradeep it could be a little thin , but concepts has been brilliantly explained in this book,i would recommend this book to all the one s who are willing to have one chemistry book.
