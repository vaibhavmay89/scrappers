this book is not as good as other iit foundation books in market , even though it claims to be no 1 . this book has copy paste material . no chapter is originally written everything is copied from cbse text books. it is good for students who wanna excel in exams(cbse), but this book is very disappointing for students who want to go ahead of school book and want to excel in olympiads.
