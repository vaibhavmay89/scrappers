this book covers the latest prescribed syllabus of JEE main. lots of examples are given at the very beginning of each chapter and problems are divided into 2 sections(same as previous books of TMH). But there is one problem in THM s books, i.e., the problems are not properly oriented according to the level. for ex. one should start from easy problems and then would go to medium and harder problems. They should assemble the problems acc. to difficulty level so that one can gain confidence by doing some less difficult problems. Otherwise the book is great to get prepared for JEE mains.
