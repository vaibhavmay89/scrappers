I had bought this book back on november 2012 during my class XI on Kerala board(I am currently at XII). I had gone through some pages and i found that it is hard to follow this book. After i had completed my plus one course i had bought HC Verma and so after reading some review and suggestions at some sites. Later i came to know that i was wrong in my decision. I was lacking a proper strategy. My best friend(Namely Mohammed Faiz Saneen guided me well). Now i am pretty addicted to the method used by the auther NK Bajaj to solve many sums. Takes time to click the concepts but if you stick with it and try you maximum solving each and every question you will surely benefit. 
1) Having almost 150 Questions(average) Per chapter. 
2) Solutions for almost all question(Say every questions). 
3) Extensive theory(I would say so) With nice collection of solved examples. Practically there is no need of looking for theory elsewhere. It will take time to understand(Not bad). 
4) Nice pages with nice fonts will make you stick with the book. 
Best of luck and wish me best of luck too......
