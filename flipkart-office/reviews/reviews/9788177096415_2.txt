I used this book when i was preparing for JEE. Learning steps in other subjects include understanding the theory and then solving problems whereas in physical chemistry its the other way around. You need to practice more and more to understand the concepts.
Once you understand the basics well then solving problems from this book becomes fun. You need to master the early chapters well to get comfortable in the later chapters of this book.
A must-have for competitive exam aspirants.
