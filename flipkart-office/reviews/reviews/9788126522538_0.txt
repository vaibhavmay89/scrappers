This is a really good book in my opinion, simply because of the way concepts are explained. It s simple, concise, and if you read it properly, you feel someone is actually explaining stuff to you real-time.
It is finally a Resnick Halliday :) and adapted for IIT JEE! Provides for the a pretty much perfect read :)
