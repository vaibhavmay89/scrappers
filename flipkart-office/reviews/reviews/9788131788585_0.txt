Well indeed its a very good book. Few tips and tricks are good, and the specialty of this book is each sum is new of its own kind.. But be prepared with your school s prescribed text book before u start this one, since this book is not for starters. U can surely crack state JEE s if u even solve 60% of the sums by own.
