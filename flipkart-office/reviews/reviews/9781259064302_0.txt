 The book is a collection of quite a lot of information and covers most of the topics in Biology, however this isnt an ultimate book for NEET. The scope of the book in some topics seems limited, however there is more than essential in some topics; which is actually good!
It is best suited for someone who has already learnt concepts and seeks to Revise them just in time for an exam.
A coloured edition with eye catching illustrations would have been much better!
The book is in right size and is easy to handle....
