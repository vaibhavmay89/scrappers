I earlier owned the same book by another publisher Radha Publishing House or some other publisher like that and the quality of the book and paper as well as print was so bad that I didn t feel like reading anything from it. This book is quite better than the other books and there is obviously isn t much to say about SL Loney s books which are always great! 
Go for this one, it will certainly help you a lot.
