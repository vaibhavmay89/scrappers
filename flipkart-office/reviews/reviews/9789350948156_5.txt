I think its the best book with a low cost for completing physics even if you start from XII std.This book contains synopsis of nearly 50 pages covering every topics which are awesomely written by D.C PANDEY . They contain detailed explanations along with all important formulas which are necessary for solving Mcq\ s quickly.Regrading the Mcq\ s,they are nearly about 50-60 sums in all important chapters and 20-30 sums in other chapters.They are all entrance examination questions which are best and even harder than H.C VERMA as u know they are \ Arihant\ questions. Finally this book is worth and very useful for \ JEE MAINS\ .
