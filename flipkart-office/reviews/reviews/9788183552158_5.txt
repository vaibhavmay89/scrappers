The problems in the book are really VERY difficult and challenging. I personally love solving this book. however, THIS BOOK CANNOT MAKE YOU A MASTER OF PHYSICS. The very first question of the book is quite difficult and the level keeps on soaring.
The level of the questions is way higher than IIT JEE and obviously JEE MAINS/AIEEE .
I m sure you can t even do a single question after completing your NCERTS/Pradeeps.
SUMMARY:
Buy this book only if you find HC Verma VERY easy, you have ample of time and you love physics.
TIPS FOR ATTEMPTING THIS BOOK:-
1) make sure your concepts are clear
2) attempt only after yo ve done difficult problems from other books like HCV
3) Solving the book can be very time consuming ( I takes me around 10-15 min per question)
4) Do not get demoralized if u r not able to solve the questions.
5) There r solutions to this book online ( on blogspot) . Look at them only after you have tried a question at least 10 times.
