 This book is great for all those who have gifted minds, but for people with average intelligence like me this book is real difficult to solve 
Said that, if at all u are able to solve all of its questions and mostly w/o peeping into hints, then my friend cracking IIT (assuming u have solved books on chemistry by M.S Chouhan; N. Awasthi & R.C Mukhrejee) is just a walk in the park. 
I would recommend that u use H.C Verma for understanding the theory part. 
Hope this was useful.
