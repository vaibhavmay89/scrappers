 I ordered this book for my sister who is IIT M.Sc aspirant. This book is collection of previous year JAM question papers and also some model sets. As an ex-IIT student I can surely tell that there will be no repeating in JAM paper but solving previous year papers make oneself more potent to solve same pattern of questions in the actual JAM exam. 
Great delivery system from Flipkart as always. I recommend this book.
