 I bought this book for my jee mains & advance practice and it has helped me in resolving all my problems in organic chemistry.
It has an easy to understand language and is given with fine examples & exceptions. Apart from this it also has excercises based on topics that help you to test and analyse yourself.
All in all it is a must buy for all those who wish to score good in organic chemistry espacially in advance.
