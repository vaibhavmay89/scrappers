This book is an excellent one for all those students preparing for Engineering Entrances Like JEE, or their state joints. This is a must have book in electricity and magnetism and I suggest students must have the entire series of DC Pandey. Large question bank of questions of all levels and standards, crystal clear text material and a large number of shortcuts help prepare for the time-limited exams like JEE. Buy this and enjoy. Cheers!
