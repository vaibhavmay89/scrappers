Please do not buy this book. It is completely waste of money. Especially, from WE Retail they will send you only practice book and not textbook as described in the website. This book comes in set of two book i.e.- textbook and practice book and a CD. 
I ordered this book and found that they have sent me wrong book(Practice). I requested for replacement. But the replacement book was also wrong one. It seems that they don t won t to sell the original book as described. If yo ll buy this book yo ll regret. 
This book is made by combining some other books. Instead of buying this book you can buy 
1) JD Lee- Inorganic chemistry
2) Organic Chemistry by T. W. Graham Solomons and
3) Atkin s Physical Chemistry Or you can also buy OP Tondon
