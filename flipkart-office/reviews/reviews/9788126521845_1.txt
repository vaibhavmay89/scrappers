I ordered this book for preparation of a competitive exam just to brush up my concepts and refer to i had a doubt or something.... this book fails on both accounts neither has good concepts or solved examples. on top of it they have used theorems and notations of B.Sc mathematics level. Solved examples are just collected randomly from here and there... Waste of money and time( which obviously authors did not devote while writing)
