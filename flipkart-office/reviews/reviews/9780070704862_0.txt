I bought this book from TMH site. Note that this book is very big and lot of concepts are covered for JEE. There are lot of typos in the book which is irritating. I only solved first 30 pages and already found closely 20+ typos. So beware of this low quality in proof reading if you want to buy this book. If you want to become thorough in algebra solve only these books 1. Hall & Knight 2. Bernard & Child. Period.
