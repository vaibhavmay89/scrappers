World fame Morrison Boyd gets a nasty form in this book. Sonal Rajora has done a good work by adding some objective questions at the end of the chapters but this is simply not good enough for aspiring IITians or Chemists as it dangerously lacks detailed reactions mechanism that can be found in Solomons edited by Ms Chouhan. However this book is not completely out of the business.
