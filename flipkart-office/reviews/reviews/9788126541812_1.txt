If you are comparing this book to the MORRISON AND BOYD then this one is sure better. The print quality will make you fall in love with organic chemistry. The questions provided are average. But the theory part is AWSMM !!!! The only book i personally feel can outmatch this book is BROWNE AND FOOTE . But that book is not set for IIT-JEE. It has some additional concepts as well. But yeah.... That is the best. But this one is definitely better than all other organic chemistry books (for theory) !
