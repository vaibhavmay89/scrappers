a very good book from atul singhal... it has all the neccessary facts for iitjee.... but a little bit explanation of mechanisms is missing,,,.. but its objective questions are really good... this book is app for revision where u can go through the concepts and attempt good question.... for detailed mechansims i prefer solomons n fryhle for iitjee... but still its a great attempt by atul singhal...
