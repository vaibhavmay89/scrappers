 First of all, i would like to tell you that I have really solved parts of the books and not complaining just to make the comment read.
i am not able to see any of the pros in the books.
hence the cons follow:-
1. the paper quality is not adorable
2. the QUESTIONS ARE NOT TYPED CORRECTLY!! i have seen a no. of questions in which the whole diagram has been changed. 
3. In physics, every 1 out of 5 questions gets a mistake, i had been trying the questions , but get confused as to why the answer is not coming(though my conceptual understanding is strong). and at last when i see another book it comes true.
4. the questions are presented in a congested manner.
So now if you want to purchase ,, then you may go ahead.....risk at your own
