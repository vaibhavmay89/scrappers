Before purchasing any book we need a good review about the book. Ratings alone are not sufficient and neither is only the summary of the book. In absence of reviews it would be extremely handy if the contents of the book are given as they appear in the index. This would better help buyers to determine whether to buy the book or not. Thank you.
