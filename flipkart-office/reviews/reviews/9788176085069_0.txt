 I purchased this book with the recommendation of my coaching teacher....and it has proved to be very much helpful, though if u compare the matter in NCERT with is book.....u will find a huge gap but...u have to bridge this to crack PMTs, AIIMS , NEET and other such exams.....many many extra this are provided in the book with an objective approach....i personally liked it a lot.............the question bank is awesome.....rather its HUGE......as a whole this book is a must for cracking medical entrances .....
I strongly recommend this book for the medical aspirants.....
