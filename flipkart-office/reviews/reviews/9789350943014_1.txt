 
It has been conceived by keeping in mind the latest trend of questions, and the level of different types of students. Each book covers the complete syllabus of JEE Main in 40 Days; divided into day-wise-learning modules with clear grounding into concepts and sufficient practice with solved and unsolved questions on that day. Also, on last 3 days you get three full length Mock Tests in all 3 books that makes you ready to face the test. Its coherent presentation and compatibility with the latest prescribed syllabus and pattern will prove extremely useful for the students.
 Concepts discussed clearly and directly without being superfluous.
