This Mathematics book is the best mathematical guide I ever met. It contains everything in its best and concise way. I purchased it 1 month before JEE Advanced and it seriously shook my confidence about mathematics. It has very diverse questions and could be said quite hard also. This book can be used not only for JEE but to clear the basic mathematics also. A Highly recommended piece for those who don t go to coachings.
