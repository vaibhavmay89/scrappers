The book has wide range of quality tough questions and jusr enough practice in unsolved, not to much not too less. I specially like the chapter tests given at the end with a time constraint whoch will challenge the student.
Over all a book for those who are preparing for jee advanced. 
P.s. The book requries the student to have the ability to solve average questions, n then only can one give a. Das a try.
