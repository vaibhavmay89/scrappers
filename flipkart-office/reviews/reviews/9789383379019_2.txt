Think Thrice before you buy this.Bought for my cousin.Theory is somewhat good.Though they say that they have fully solved examples and exercises..Even topics under Inorganic chemistry are included under Physical chemistry without no solution for any excercise question.No exercises are solved in physical chemistry (First 6 booklets).All u hav is Answer key.For the next 6 booklets(organic and Inorganic) they have solved examples and exercises(with detailed solutions).
