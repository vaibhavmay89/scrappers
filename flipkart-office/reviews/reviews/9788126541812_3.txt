this book has been a boon to me. it covers almost every topic in a very elaborated way. i would recommend it to every organic lover and of course to those giving jee. 
the main problem is that it does not cover much problems. for that you may have to purchase some other book, in case you don t have q. banks or study materials. it also does not cover jee problems (prev yrs) and every chap has about 10-15 mcqs only and subjective questions are not quite worth doing. 
and the chapters are not given in ncert style and you may have to look for index for different topics. some topic which must be explained earlier are explained later on like aromatic compounds. 
but still, if you have the courage, and you want to understand the organic to the best of its level, this must be your choice!
