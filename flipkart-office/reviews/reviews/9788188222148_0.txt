Arihant has done its magic once again... This buk is clearly awesome... All Physics lovers shud try solving Irodov alongside this solution book (provided they are very clear with the basic concepts) For the basics, I d prefer HC Verma or Resnick Halliday Walker... After being thorough with the basics, this buk really comes in handy... 
The one key feature of this buk above all others is that after each question, they have given other qns of the same kind so that we can make sure that we understood that concept... Highly Useful for JEE Advanced...
