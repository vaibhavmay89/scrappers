I was already in love with Solomon and Fryhle s Organic Chemistry, and then I saw this book, reading it was lovely. It is in a concise, to the point and unnecessary details have been omitted. It has also become much well presented then the original book. And the biggest addition would be the additional exercises. If you have done organic chemistry from this book, be assured that your IIT JEE paper, organic chemistry would be smooth.
