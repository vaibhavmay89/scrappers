It s actual price was around 1400 but I got it from flipkart for 800! Really good books, contains only questions , and no theory. In fact , it contains all types of questions asked in JEE from comprehensions to multiple choice to integer type questions , and the too Topic wise . 
It allows one to test their knowledge of the topic. I would recommend either this series or the 35 year IIT papers series to all aspirants ( Both are great). And for revision , this is probably the best book.
