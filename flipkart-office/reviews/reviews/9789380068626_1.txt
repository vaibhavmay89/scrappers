The problems in General Physics by I.E Irodov is a spectacular book containing numerous problems and numericals that will put you to the test.I recommend using The Concepts of Physics by HC Verma to go through the Theory and Concepts and then try to solve the problems as it ll be a lot easier.A must have for IIT-JEE and AIEEE aspirants.
