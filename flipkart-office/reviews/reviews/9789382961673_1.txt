 Extremely happy to receive the set of books as per standards set by flipkart.
Full transperency and timely delievery.......
The sets of books are clearly few notches above the standard books available in the market.
The only problem is that proof reading is not properly done especially in maths book.
I could find atleast 6 errors in just 1 chapter of maths. 
Overall a great book... A must read for IIT aspirants......
