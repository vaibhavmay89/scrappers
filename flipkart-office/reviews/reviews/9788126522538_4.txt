First of all, the main difference from the original text is that a separate exercise for objective problems and an additional subjective problems exercise has been added. But being acquainted with Amit Gupta through bansal classes i expected problems of more higher difficulty. Some of the problems in the additional exercise are directly from H C verma ,so the other ones must be from other international authors. 
Pros:
1) Theory is sufficient for JEE 
2) Printing is of very good quality 
3) Answers are given to both odd and even numbered problems unlike the original text. 
4) Problems are solved through the four C s approach which is a good approach for the new analytical type of JEE problems. 
Cons:
1)Would have appreciated a few dozen more problems.
 No other Cons.
