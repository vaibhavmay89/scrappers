The book is great for building one s concepts. Every topic has been started from zero level and has been built upto the IITJEE level and covers the full syllabus of IITJEE in a comprehensive way. Each and every reaction given in the book is accompanied with its mechanism and stereochemistry , so if you want to learn reaction mechanisms this is the best book in the market. chapters have many solved examples and exercises are good but the only disadvantage is that all the exercises dont have the answers. But all together it is a great book.
