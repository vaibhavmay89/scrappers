Folks, Even if you join the best college or the best coaching the teachers may not teach you better than this book. this book is owned by every student of sri chaitanya narayana academy which has maximum toppers in top 100, so i bought this book and found it very useful . concepts are given in detail and not even a small concept is left out. frankly speaking but after i joined sri chaitanya narayana academy i found it difficult to cope up with other students as they had already completed the syllabus of 11, 12. only with the help of this book i am able to understand the concepts (i mean the teachers dont teach well cos they think we already know 11, 12 state concepts) that s my personal experience...anyway there are more than 300 problems in each chapter which is more than enough for practice for iit.
