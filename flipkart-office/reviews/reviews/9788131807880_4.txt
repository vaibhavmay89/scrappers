This book is good. The content is simple and important points are listed. Some topics like fluid mechanics, machine design are covered in detail. Every chapter has 400-500 objective questions for sure and they have high probability in being asked in PSU exams. Yet important and vast areas like production engineering, heat and mass transfer, industrial engineering are very limited (only 2 or 3 pages). If you just want objective questions to be thoroughly prepared without the content for understanding concepts, you can jolly well buy this book. If you content explanation for all chapters in detail, try other books. However this book is good and useful.
