This is the first product I bought from Flipkart , their service is simply amazing. 
This is the only book I read during the last days before my JEE main exam and I can guarantee you that this book provides you all the knowledge that you need to have to crack JEE main exam. It has all the important stuff from the NCERT textbook and all the formulaes that you would need ,but some of the questions in the daily drills section are of little higher level than JEE main , so i would recommend you to give more priority to the entrance questions . Though I am awaiting my result but I know that this book helped me a lot to achieve a better rank
