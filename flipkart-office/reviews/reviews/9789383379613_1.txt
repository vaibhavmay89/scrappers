this book contains part wise tests,full syllabus test papers,2002-2013 AIEEE solved papers which is very helpful in preparing for JEE main.Each paper is based on some full marks,time limits and instructions are also given, i.e.,to try and solve the paper and then see the solutions.One can analyse his/her rank with the marks he/she gets after solving each paper with the JEE main rank predictor/anlyser given at the beginning of the book.. Disha should improve their page quality.Otherwise, it is a fine book.
