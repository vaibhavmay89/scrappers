Everyone solves Irodov s Problems in General Physics and it is very popular for the competitive exams. And this book teaches you how to solve them(only the mechanics portion though).
The book is really helpful if one is looking to build up and extend his concepts on mechanics. It covers basic Newtonian mechanics and relativistic mechanics as well.
The treatment is unique but might appear dry and technical at times but the examples are very lucid.
