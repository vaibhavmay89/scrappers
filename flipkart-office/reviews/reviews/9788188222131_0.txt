A great buy for anyone wanting to be best in physics.
This book has a whole lot of information. Though the presentation is not too well but if u have read it once or twice your sure to find everything in it.
Actually it contains information which is somewhat misplaced but it s surely there.
The Extra features at the end of each chapter are very useful. All the important results & tips & trick are given in that section.
Optics & Modern Physics both have indeed some mind boggling questions.
