 This is an excellent book with 360 NEET-PG questions. All the questions are very stimulating and I found myself enjoying while I was going through the book. The explanations are concise but sufficient to get the facts registered. But I would suggest readers to make small notes if they wish. 
After reading this book I feel much more confident and am hungry for more NEET pattern questions...
