 Theory of counting is a complete book for Permutation, Combination & Probability.It emphasis on all the methods to solve the various problems. I could see some techniques which are missing in other books. This book is short and crisp with 5 levels of graded problems.
The best part is all solutions are detailed.
I would recommend all JEE aspirants to buy this books definitely.
