During last 2 years, after completing my Engineering from one of the very reputed NITs,though I have come across many books claiming to cover entire engineering syllabus, pecularity of this book is really remarkable. I, and many other students like me, who were in search of a book that can give a quick and error-free recap of the entire B.Tech. syllabus, will be greatly benefitted by this book. I would STRONGLY recommend this book to all those students who are sincerely preparing for the UPSC Engineering Services Examination or any other engineering competitive examination. 5 STAR from my side!!!
