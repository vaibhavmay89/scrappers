Till now i ve gone through several books for inorganic... and the syllabus of inorganic has been always confusing, the theory given in the book is straight and builds very strong concept.... the language is made as simple as possible.... It also contains exercises which have plenty of concept building problems..... There s no book like this one.... I would recommend to click on the buy option...and feel its essence...
