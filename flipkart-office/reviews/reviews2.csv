Best book for JEE main. help in advance also.
The book is very good for jee main preparation. Theory is given in brief. Best way to have a revision of old lessons but useful to set them on my mind in little time 
Pros:
1) problems at the end of every day makes the lesson good and help to judge how the preparation is.
2) The problems are very related to JEE main syllabus and explanation is good enough. 
Cons:
Not a good choice for JEE advance but it can help for advance level also.

"The book is great to study organic chemistry but requires you to have atleast some basic knowledge of the subject..
Pros..
1. Includes all required reaction mechanisms to understand better -an edge over books books like Arihant Organic Chemistry by RK Gupta 
2. Stereochemistry(and explanation with structures) is just mind blowing.
3.A lot of irrelevant parts(wrt IIT JEE) has been removed.
4. Exercises and intext questions are far better than Indian writers
5. Good explanations.
Cons..
1. As the book is an adaptive version of the original Original Chemistry By Solomons & Fryhle a lot of good illustrations have also been removed in order to make it compact.
2. Two chapters that have been added at the end of the book are not so good.
3. It requires a pre-knowledge of the subject else you will be stuck many a times.

and the chapters are not given in ncert style and you may have to look for index for different topics. some topic which must be explained earlier are explained later on like aromatic compounds.

Second : adaptation by MSC : The book is good in explanations where solomons has been written as in original work . Then MSC adds his own stuff from JEE point of view . The added stuff is good content coverage wise but explanation wise its really weak . He has not taken any pains to explain his added stuff on the same level as solomons. This makes the book lopsided . Also some of the concepts added are not needed for JEE but thats alright ; its always good to know a little extra.

All NCERT questions are included, so you need not buy a RD Sharma for boards. However, Exercise questions may sometime seem too difficult or the solution mind-boggling, and such a large number of questions may prove to be useless as it takes too much time.

 This book is great for all those who have gifted minds, but for people with average intelligence like me this book is real difficult to solve 
Said that, if at all u are able to solve all of its questions and mostly w/o peeping into hints, then my friend cracking IIT (assuming u have solved books on chemistry by M.S Chouhan; N. Awasthi & R.C Mukhrejee) is just a walk in the park. 
I would recommend that u use H.C Verma for understanding the theory part.

5.in chapter word formation author gave rank method to count from start no explanation what if a specific word has very large rank, isn t there a short method ? :) 
6.in chapter sum of all number formed no questions on ... what is sum of all numbers when they have 0 and repeated digits?? why?? 
7. in chapter distribution 
(a)for distribution of distinct objects in identical boxes ...there is a formulae given...but that formulae doesn t hold when number of distinct elements are eqaul in atleast 2 identical boxes ? :)

 The book is best if you know every holy shit and then go for the sums, for a class 11 student, if you study n finish a single chapter and then go for this book to solve question from the same chapter, it will not be ideal for you!

"Pros - 
Firstly, this book is awsome ! It has deepest theory and every detail of it is presented in a great manner. Furthurmore, it has many solved examples after every single topic which makes it easier to understand.
How many of you had trouble learning IONIC EQUILIBRIUM or REDOX REACTION ?? I did. I searched many books to find good text on these topics.... And i did found them.... But this book is above them all. Previous years questions of examinations have also been added .
Cons -
There are few cons.... The major one being poor quality of answers to the questions. DONT refer this book for questions (until you have too much time) . RC MUKHERJEE was and still is the best book for attempting problems and practicing them.
Final Word-
1. Read theory from this book.
2. Solve RC Mukherjee.
3. Solve questions of your coaching classes.
4. Solve previous years exams questions.

 Merits :This book is rich in concepts and problems essential to crack IIT JEE. New and different types of problems are introduced and strategies to crack there are explained very well.

Demerits : A pile of calculation errors and the answers to some questions in exercises (MCQ) are provided with wrong answers. Some topics like azeotropes ,emf values are all mismatched.

 Pros:
1) Theory is very comprehensive and states out some unique points.
2) It has got very good problems for discussion
3) Important Tips and Ideas are a chief spotlight of this book. This section provides with useful tips and lists out some cautions and misconceptions useful for a student.
Cons:
1) The number of problems is very less.
2) Not very good for a beginner.
3) Theory does not have a wide coverage,i.e., it misses out some portions in theory which are vital for current trends of JEE

 Good book with excellent graded problems. Theory is straight forward as they mention. At least some very little basic chemistry understanding is needed for succesfully reading this book. Whatever the reason, i liked this book unconditionally. It should be useful compared to other books available in market. 
I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 so that author can remove errors in few worked out problems (e.g. a problem following very lengthy one in first chapter.) and i hope this point i mentioned doesnt under estimate the whole value of book.

 The book is a collection of quite a lot of information and covers most of the topics in Biology, however this isnt an ultimate book for NEET. The scope of the book in some topics seems limited, however there is more than essential in some topics; which is actually good!
It is best suited for someone who has already learnt concepts and seeks to Revise them just in time for an exam.

"First of all, the main difference from the original text is that a separate exercise for objective problems and an additional subjective problems exercise has been added. But being acquainted with Amit Gupta through bansal classes i expected problems of more higher difficulty. Some of the problems in the additional exercise are directly from H C verma ,so the other ones must be from other international authors. 
Pros:
1) Theory is sufficient for JEE 
2) Printing is of very good quality 
3) Answers are given to both odd and even numbered problems unlike the original text. 
4) Problems are solved through the four C s approach which is a good approach for the new analytical type of JEE problems. 
Cons:
1)Would have appreciated a few dozen more problems.

"The original Resnick Halliday is a masterpiece in physics education. It is used as a brand name to boost up the sale of this book. It is claimed that the original Resnick Halliday book is adapted for IITJEE. In reality, it is a low grade book by author of a Kota based coaching class with a few diagrams and bits and pieces copied from the original book. 
The original Resnick Halliday is matured over several years and has no conceptual error, no typographical error. This book has plenty of typographical error and a few conceptual errors. So, it is not recommended for students. Only teachers capable of locating the errors should use it. I suggest the authors to be fair to the readers by publishing an errata on the net. 
You can get solutions of all questions and exercises in original Resnick Halliday. They are available in Instructors resource whose copy is available on internet. This adapted version has only questions and answers. But no solutions. Quality of questions and exercises in original book is much better than the adapted one. 
Original Resnick Halliday has index for reference. The adapted one does not have. 
The most serious blunder is about the approach of book. The original book targets teaching concepts and concepts used as tools for solving problems. The adapted book rather targets making the reader familiar with patterns on problems appearing in competitive exams. the reader will learn the pattern based methods of problem solving. Concepts may be learnt as a secondary outcome. This is typical approach of many a successful teachers in the commercial field of JEE coaching. There are many guide books written by them. This is just one more book of the same class. But publisher and author has smartly borrowed (for some fee?) the brandname of famous Resnick Halliday to attract customers. 
They intended to combine goodness of Resnick Halliday with focus on JEE. What has come out from the experiment is a caricature of Resnick Halliday . If the publisher wants to be honest, the book should be published without any reference to Resnick Halliday .","21 Mar 2015","fraud - do not be mistaken by words Resnick Halliday on the cover of this book","1","Anthony","http://www.flipkart.com/physics-iit-jee-volume-1-english-1st/product-reviews/itmdytmwz7gzmyph?pid=9788126522538&srno=b_201&al=VI9czj2bJnJQkx2e5ZE67IPjgBneLXZTdMJyAPAP7nWlYuLN6%2FlN94aLq2lx4bRfFLwHQxVDMNU%3D&ref=2ebe482c-2563-419b-b22b-22e7806553d8",

"The original Resnick Halliday is a masterpiece in physics education. It is used as a brand name to boost up the sale of this book. It is claimed that the original Resnick Halliday book is adapted for IITJEE. In reality, it is a low grade book by author of a Kota based coaching class with a few diagrams and bits and pieces copied from the original book. 
The original Resnick Halliday is matured over several years and has no conceptual error, no typographical error. This book has plenty of typographical error and a few conceptual errors. So, it is not recommended for students. Only teachers capable of locating the errors should use it. I suggest the authors to be fair to the readers by publishing an errata on the net. 
You can get solutions of all questions and exercises in original Resnick Halliday. They are available in Instructors resource whose copy is available on internet. This adapted version has only questions and answers. But no solutions. Quality of questions and exercises in original book is much better than the adapted one. 
Original Resnick Halliday has index for reference. The adapted one does not have. 
The most serious blunder is about the approach of book. The original book targets teaching concepts and concepts used as tools for solving problems. The adapted book rather targets making the reader familiar with patterns on problems appearing in competitive exams. the reader will learn the pattern based methods of problem solving. Concepts may be learnt as a secondary outcome. This is typical approach of many a successful teachers in the commercial field of JEE coaching. There are many guide books written by them. This is just one more book of the same class. But publisher and author has smartly borrowed (for some fee?) the brandname of famous Resnick Halliday to attract customers. 
They intended to combine goodness of Resnick Halliday with focus on JEE. What has come out from the experiment is a caricature of Resnick Halliday . If the publisher wants to be honest, the book should be published without any reference to Resnick Halliday .","21 Mar 2015","fraud - do not be mistaken by words Resnick Halliday appearing on the cover of this book","1","Anthony","http://www.flipkart.com/physics-iit-jee-other-engineering-entrance-examinations-volume-1-english/product-reviews/itmdbw4pfrpruj9d?pid=9788126536788&srno=b_348&ref=ea6f803f-557f-4637-ac0b-d928a87105e5",

"I had bought this book back on november 2012 during my class XI on Kerala board(I am currently at XII). I had gone through some pages and i found that it is hard to follow this book. After i had completed my plus one course i had bought HC Verma and so after reading some review and suggestions at some sites. Later i came to know that i was wrong in my decision. I was lacking a proper strategy. My best friend(Namely Mohammed Faiz Saneen guided me well). Now i am pretty addicted to the method used by the auther NK Bajaj to solve many sums. Takes time to click the concepts but if you stick with it and try you maximum solving each and every question you will surely benefit. 
1) Having almost 150 Questions(average) Per chapter. 
2) Solutions for almost all question(Say every questions). 
3) Extensive theory(I would say so) With nice collection of solved examples. Practically there is no need of looking for theory elsewhere. It will take time to understand(Not bad). 
4) Nice pages with nice fonts will make you stick with the book.

 Good book with excellent graded problems. Theory is straight forward as they mention. At least some very little basic chemistry understanding is needed for succesfully reading this book.

 If you are preparing for an entrance exam like SAT or JEE (Advance) and have already completed Irodov and HCV and all other sorts of books and papers.....and are looking for a book that provides you the toughest problems for the final revisions, then this book is for you.
Dont buy this if you are preparing for MAINS or any other exams. This contains 4 topics, namely mechanics, heat & molecular physics, optics and electromagnetism which are toughest topics in physics. The best part are the solutions. The numerical aspect is good, but the detailed imaginative way of answering has made this book a final and ultimate refer guide.

 First of all, i would like to tell you that I have really solved parts of the books and not complaining just to make the comment read.
i am not able to see any of the pros in the books.
hence the cons follow:-
1. the paper quality is not adorable
2. the QUESTIONS ARE NOT TYPED CORRECTLY!! i have seen a no. of questions in which the whole diagram has been changed. 
3. In physics, every 1 out of 5 questions gets a mistake, i had been trying the questions , but get confused as to why the answer is not coming(though my conceptual understanding is strong). and at last when i see another book it comes true.
4. the questions are presented in a congested manner.

"I use this book to teach my Daughter - Book has good description and is full of excellent examples. Also it takes an algebra based approach which I think makes it ideal for people who don t have background in calculus.
Lot of practical applications are given as well - Book is verbose and it really needs time to read. If you are short of time, use H.C.Verma but if you want to enjoy physics and that too a strong conceptual overview, this book should be on the top of your list. At times I see some definitions to be not very precise but if you read carefully and solve the problems, you will definitely become strong in physics - Instructors who teach may find the book rewarding. Supplementing this book has lot of solutions for NCERT and their objective questions look good though the there are no detailed solutions.

"I use this book to teach my Daughter - Book has good description and is full of excellent examples. Also it takes an algebra based approach which I think makes it ideal for people who don t have background in calculus.
Lot of practical applications are given as well - Book is verbose and it really needs time to read. If you are short of time, use H.C.Verma but if you want to enjoy physics and that too a strong conceptual overview, this book should be on the top of your list. At times I see some definitions to be not very precise but if you read carefully and solve the problems, you will definitely become strong in physics - Instructors who teach may find the book rewarding. Supplementing this book has lot of solutions for NCERT and their objective questions look good though the there are no detailed solutions. 
While the book is expensive, I think it is worth the price and solving all problems can make a person to take state level entrance and AIPMT. For IIT, you are better off with HC Verma with great collection of problems.","02 Jan 2015","Great introduction of intermediate physics","4","","http://www.flipkart.com/fundamentals-physics-must-have-resource-book-cbse-jee-neet-ug-syllabi-class-11-english/product-reviews/itme63yfqark34nm?pid=9788126532445&srno=b_730&ref=43fc39d4-581a-4e1d-98fd-73ff4ba9588a",

 Good book with excellent graded problems. Theory is straight forward as they mention. At least some very little basic chemistry understanding is needed for succesfully reading this book.

Then MSC adds his own stuff from JEE point of view . The added stuff is good content coverage wise but explanation wise its really weak . He has not taken any pains to explain his added stuff on the same level as solomons. This makes the book lopsided . Also some of the concepts added are not needed for JEE but thats alright ; its always good to know a little extra.

3)assertion and reason question are well explained 
4)very few mistakes (only printing mistakes)
5)detailed explanation of the zoology answers( some concepts are outside ncert like aiims exams always does please mind only some concepts) 
cons (very few )
1)some printing mistakes (like 3-4 word per 100 pages sor so )
2)some diagrams of organic compounds and coordination compound are incorrect (till now i have found 2 wrong figs)

"It is the best book for orgnic chemistry covering all the topics for organic. 
The best thing is that every reaction is explained with its mechanism.i.e. from where the bond is breaking,from where the nucleophilic reagant is attacking etc. 
If you prepare from this book surely there will be no question in organic that you can t solve.
IT S THE BEST BOOK FOR PREPARATION OF ENTRANCES EXAMS. 
ALSO THE PHYSICAL CHMESITRY BY CENGAGE IS THE BEST FOR EXAMS 
A very good book to get a firm understanding for organic chemistry....for iit and for cbse. Except for a few mistakes here and there....a very great book to buy!!!!!!
I bought this book a few days ago and I am seriously glad that I bought it. The book features a very good collection of solved problems and exercises. Moreover the author has taken the pain to highlight important conceptual questions in the exercise to facilitate for easy revision during the last phases of exam preparation. Also, the theory is very well given and easy to grasp and understand. The solutions to the exercises which are given at the end of each chapter are very descriptive and help to any doubts which arise while solving the questions. I am yet to see any thing in this book which I do not like. It is a very good book to build your basic concepts (like GOC, Nomenclature and Isomerism) which are going to be indispensable while solving the chapters ahead (like hydrocarbons, alkyl halides,alcohols,ketones,etc.)
I would recommend this book to every JEE aspirant.

 I bought this book a few days ago and I am seriously glad that I bought it. The book features a very good collection of solved problems and exercises. Moreover the author has taken the pain to highlight important conceptual questions in the exercise to facilitate for easy revision during the last phases of exam preparation. Also, the theory is very well given and easy to grasp and understand. The solutions to the exercises which are given at the end of each chapter are very descriptive and help to any doubts which arise while solving the questions. I am yet to see any thing in this book which I do not like. It is a very good book to build your basic concepts (like GOC, Nomenclature and Isomerism) which are going to be indispensable while solving the chapters ahead (like hydrocarbons, alkyl halides,alcohols,ketones,etc.)
I would recommend this book to every JEE aspirant. ","02 Sep 2013","Cracking!!!","5","Anshaj Khare","http://www.flipkart.com/organic-chemistry-joint-entrance-examination-jee-advanced-english-1st/product-reviews/itmdx925s2agqajf?pid=9788131519172&srno=b_873&ref=bc70c894-b9d9-4aef-96fe-40ef9d8ac10a",

 Good book with excellent graded problems. Theory is straight forward as they mention. At least some very little basic chemistry understanding is needed for succesfully reading this book. Whatever the reason, i liked this book unconditionally. It should be useful compared to other books available in market. 
I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 so that author can remove errors in few worked out problems (e.g. a problem following very lengthy one in first chapter.) and i hope this point i mentioned doesnt under estimate the whole value of book.

 I liked this book due to its simplicity and comprehensivenes in explaining the concepts necessary from ground up. All basics before starting the periodic table are provided in the book. I liked two aspects much 1) work book excersices here and there for all intermdiary of chapters and 2) practical application examples as i saw in most costly foreign author chemistry books.
I give 4 stars instead of 5 only due to the lack of advanced coverage still more. But those stuffs and advanced treatment may not be much available in indian autor books, but i saw some in JD Lee and Cottons Basic & Advanced Inorganic chemistry.
Overall it is a very excellent effort from author Dr. R K Gupta.
Alcohol meter (breathalyzer) application logic using K2Cr2O7 and ethanol is excellent as provided in example excercises.
For IIT, advanced engg. college entrances and AIIMS/advanced medical entrance aspirants will find this most useful. The autor gives priority in explaining to dull/average student in his entire book coverage than for most brilliant one.
But for chemistry lovers like me, i expect coordination chemistry still more advanced and in fact this topic is much sought after in IIT entrances. 
I promise anybody will love to read this book and the well graded excercises.

 I bought this book a few days ago and I am seriously glad that I bought it. The book features a very good collection of solved problems and exercises. Moreover the author has taken the pain to highlight important conceptual questions in the exercise to facilitate for easy revision during the last phases of exam preparation. Also, the theory is very well given and easy to grasp and understand. The solutions to the exercises which are given at the end of each chapter are very descriptive and help to any doubts which arise while solving the questions. I am yet to see any thing in this book which I do not like. It is a very good book to build your basic concepts (like GOC, Nomenclature and Isomerism) which are going to be indispensable while solving the chapters ahead (like hydrocarbons, alkyl halides,alcohols,ketones,etc.)

It allows one to test their knowledge of the topic. I would recommend either this series or the 35 year IIT papers series to all aspirants ( Both are great).

"I kept looking for a good book to begin calculus, without assuming anything from high-school and college where I crammed, puked and happily left calculus forgotten. I was looking for a book that has more of conceptual understanding which allows me to see where these concepts can be applied instead of just memorizing formulae. Since this time I didn t want to just graze calculus but to understand, appreciate and apply it. Calculus is all about practical, real-life problem solving than many realize. Many equations like the area of a circle, volume of a cylinder to equations that explain planetary motion were derived using the fundamental ideas founded on this subject, yet it is taught in a very unfriendly, dry way which concentrates on rigour but not on intuition. Many recommended books like Calculus by Tom M Apostol, Differential and Integral Calculus by Piskunov, etc. 
However I bought this book. The first thing yo ll notice is this one stands out from the rest due to the highly illustrative nature. It s filled with numerous of graphs to get the point across in a convincing manner, digestible for a student or a self-learner alike. By that I m not saying the above books are bad. Of course they re good, that s why they re highly rated/recommended; but they re more on the rigour and less on the intuition which is what a beginner looks for when beginning a subject. They re expert-friendly and thus many (experts) recommend it. 
Oodles of problems are given at the end of each section. For every chapter, there s a Conceptual Check section which is very helpful in making sure that one is on the right track. Additionally it talks about how a problem can be solved graphically too using graphing/scientific calculator, CAS (computer algebra system), etc. The author s site has link to TEC (Tools for Enriching Calculus), a (paid) tutorial environment in which students can explore and review selected topics. Odd numbered problems have answers in an appendix. 
This is the Indian edition which is printed in black and white on decent quality paper. Its equivalent in the US is Stewart s Calculus 6: Early Transcendentals which actually costs $235 (Rs. 14, 800 approx.). It s a steal for this price, and it covers all of Calculus I, II and III extensively. However, I m reducing a star not because it isn t in colour but because they have removed notes and warnings which are invaluable (I ve seen them in the original strewn all across the text). I did buy Apostol and Piskunov s Calculus book but had I not been initially taught by Stewart I wouldn t ve started understanding those books as easily.","20 Aug 2013","Very comprehensive and beginner-friendly","4","Sundaram Ramas...","http://www.flipkart.com/calculus-early-transcendentals-functions-english-1st/product-reviews/itmdx92ydgkpgahh?pid=9788131509715&srno=b_1097&ref=17e72243-2ecf-4a2b-a6b3-f2a795f9b585",

"This is an excellent book if you need to practice past years CET papers. The 12 years papers are present together, with the respective solutions coming after each one. The questions are not divided up based on subject, as some other books. 
However, I have found several mistakes in the book as well. Some are in the question of the problem itself, when they are not reproduced properly, which either makes the problem unsolvable or gives an incorrect answer. 
In some other cases, the listed answer is incorrect, though the explanation given will mention the actual correct answer, so one needs to go and check often. 
Finally, sometimes both the listed and answer and the provided solution are incorrect. This is a real problem as you will not know whether you have somehow done something wrong in the problem, or whether the solution is itself the culprit.

"Pros:
*The questions that have been explained, have a proper explanation 
Cons:
*The book had question papers, only upto 2010.
*Only selected questions have been explained.

It is useful, would have been better if they had included the 2011 question paper also","01 Feb 2012","Satisfactory","3","Derrick Joseph","http://www.flipkart.com/iit-jam-m-sc-biotechnology-computer-applications-prev-prac-papers-english/product-reviews/itmdyuhq7krzppgh?pid=9788178127958&srno=b_1256&ref=684d248f-d1bd-4daf-b863-ab383a66e422",

 After going through I found it will surely help for entrance exams.
1.Methods of solving shown in the book are really time saving, and if you are a beginner it will tease you. 
2. Small number of problems with each is having a big variation. 
However on the other side it has a big draw back, many end chapter exercises are not provided with solutions. Only 20% of them have solutions. Could have been better if author can provide solutions to all excercices.

 Good book with excellent graded problems. Theory is straight forward as they mention. At least some very little basic chemistry understanding is needed for succesfully reading this book.

 Good book with excellent graded problems. Theory is straight forward as they mention. At least some very little basic chemistry understanding is needed for succesfully reading this book. Whatever the reason, i liked this book unconditionally. It should be useful compared to other books available in market. 
I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 so that author can remove errors in few worked out problems (e.g. a problem following very lengthy one in first chapter.) and i hope this point i mentioned doesnt under estimate the whole value of book.

 The book is best if you know every holy shit and then go for the sums, for a class 11 student, if you study n finish a single chapter and then go for this book to solve question from the same chapter, it will not be ideal for you!
there is absolutely no emphasis on basics or concept building, just some formulas are presented at the beginning of each Chapter and then you are asked to solve!

 The book is well organized but, you cannot completely rely on this book alone. For technical section other standard books are more preferable for understanding theory. But chapter wise segregation of questions makes it easy to jump into solving questions after finishing each major topic of the chapter. This boosts up the overall interest in reading. Also, since there is plenty of theory given in all the standard GATE books, I am doubtful whether they cover the entire syllabus in just 20-30 pages or not. You can have a picture of all important stuffs for GATE when you have this book in your hand.
Well, everyone preparing for GATE, I can say its a must have book but just not sufficient enough.

 Great book for preparation, although it would have been better if they were updating the questions (mock test papers) i had an older copy of the same book i guess 2011, and was pretty disappointed to see no change in mock papers, even when the jee pattern has changed.
Further there were some wrong answers that i was able to point out in the old book, and found them all the same in the new one too. So, that is an impression of lazy publishers to me.

 This is the best book so far that i have come across for practising for jee mains.
Pros:
1.) It is given with 10 years AIEEE papers & 2013 jee mains along with 10 mock tests. 
2.) The best thing about this book is that the old papers of AIEEE are given in the mock test pattern so could attempt these papers as mock tests.
3.) Excellent solutions which provide explaination to even the easiest ques. of the paper.
4.) Also it comes with a hidden surprise of a well explained theory of experimental physics & chemistry which is helpful for mains prepration.(sorry to reveal) :P

He has simply regurgitated the definitions from some other text book and relied on universities to discuss the various problems. Maths has to be taught in such a way that people understand it. Take the example of hyperbolic functions. Is this the way one has to explain the concept? Indian books by and large are horrible and this is book for a true seeker who wants to understand the true concepts in maths. Take Greens theorem in the chapter Vector calculus. It is one of the worst definitions i have ever seen but Dr. grewal says in his preface that he has written this book so that students can follow without an instructor.

3.A lot of irrelevant parts(wrt IIT JEE) has been removed.
4. Exercises and intext questions are far better than Indian writers
5. Good explanations.
Cons..
1. As the book is an adaptive version of the original Original Chemistry By Solomons & Fryhle a lot of good illustrations have also been removed in order to make it compact.
2. Two chapters that have been added at the end of the book are not so good.

"Introduction: 
I happened to first see this book in a local book fair when I was a plus two student more than a decade ago. Seniors and my teacher used to recommend this book for the most challenging problems one could find. I immediately picked up a copy. In those days, it was the favourite book for students who used to take the IIT JEE. 
More than a decade later, I am a Physics teacher. The format of the IIT-JEE has changed a lot, and these days, the book isn t that much of a favourite among plus two students as it does not contain any MCQs. However, to me, the book has come even closer to me and I still get a high when I happen to solve a few cool problems. 
Whom is this book for: 
This book is primarily meant for plus two students. However, judging the level of difficulty of the problems, any Physics lover at any level should fall in love with it. Ideally, you should start with the problems in plus two and by the time you finish your Bachelors, you should have completed it. 
Organization of the book: 
The book is divided into six parts: 
1. Mechanics: Kinematics, Dynamics, Conservation Laws, Gravitation, Rigid Body Dynamics, Elasticity, Hydrodynamics, Relativistic Mechanics 
2. Thermodynamics and Molecular Physics: Equations of state and Processes, First law and heat Capacity, Kinetic Theory and Maxwell Boltzman distribution, Entropy and the Second law, Surface tension, Phase Transitions, Transport Phenomena 
3. Electrodynamics: Constant Electric Field in Vacuum, Conductors and Dielectrics, Capacitance and Energy in an Electric Field, Current Electricity, Magnetostatics, EM Induction and Maxwell s Equations, Motion of Charged Particles in Electric and Magnetic Fields. 
4. Oscillations and Waves: Mechanical Oscillations, Electric Oscillations, Elastic waves: Acoustics, EM waves and radiation 
5. Optics: Photometry and Geometrical Optics, Interference, Diffraction, Polarization, Dispersion and Absorption, Optics of Moving Sources, Thermal Radiation and Quantum nature of Light. 
6. Atomic and Nuclear Physics: Scattering of Particles: Bohr-Rutherford atom, Wave properties of particles: Schrodinger Equation, Properties of atoms and Atomic Spectra, Molecules and Crystals, Radioactivity, Nuclear Reactions, Elementary Particles. 
In my opinion, the organization of the book is very logical. 
About the quality of the problems: Most of the problems require very clear thinking. You will hardly get any plug and chug problem. Some problems are indeed very demanding and require you to use several concepts. This was the reason why this book was so popular for IIT-JEE and is still a favourite for Physics Olympiads. Some reviewer has called this book a good workout for the brain. I couldn t agree more with him/her. 
How to use this book: First be very clear about the theory that you need for solving these problems. You should get that from any standard book. Choose your favourite: HC Verma, Resnick and Halliday or Sears and Zemansky. 
Irodov has also written two other tiny books on Mechanics and Electrodynamics. You can get these. They are excellent too. You can take help from them. 
After this, you should be able to do at least many of the problems, but maybe not all. The second stage is to put on your thinking caps and yes, don t forget to consult with your friends or teachers. With hard work, you should be able to do a substantial number of problems. Good luck! 
This book deserves nothing short of 5 stars! However, as you may have noticed, this book is available from many publishers like CBS, GK and maybe others too. The quality of the printing, the pages and the binding varies. I have noticed, the one from GK is a bit weak on the printing side. However, they offer it at the cheapest price (Rs 58 at the time of writing from flipkart, though the MRP was Rs 100). This book was originally published by Mir Publishers, Moscow which I guess has vanished after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. This publisher has given us many many quality books starting from the school level. India has benefited enormously from the close association we had with the erstwhile USSR till the eighties and early nineties. This book is a product of love from a country which has produced marvellous physicists for the world. 
About the author: Not much is known about him unfortunately. But I gather he spent years if not decades to make a course of theoretical Physics. He has written 4 books on Nuclear Physics, Mechanics and Electrodynamics and the present one. All of them except the Nuclear Physics one are available even now. You can search on google for a pdf of the Nuclear Physics book. All the books are of excellent quality. Let us pay our tributes to this great man by at least solving the problems in this book!

"The problems in the book are really VERY difficult and challenging. I personally love solving this book. however, THIS BOOK CANNOT MAKE YOU A MASTER OF PHYSICS. The very first question of the book is quite difficult and the level keeps on soaring.
The level of the questions is way higher than IIT JEE and obviously JEE MAINS/AIEEE .
I m sure you can t even do a single question after completing your NCERTS/Pradeeps.
SUMMARY:
Buy this book only if you find HC Verma VERY easy, you have ample of time and you love physics.
TIPS FOR ATTEMPTING THIS BOOK:-
1) make sure your concepts are clear
2) attempt only after yo ve done difficult problems from other books like HCV
3) Solving the book can be very time consuming ( I takes me around 10-15 min per question)
4) Do not get demoralized if u r not able to solve the questions.
5) There r solutions to this book online ( on blogspot) .

A must-have for competitive exam aspirants.","15 Jun 2012","A HC Verma for Physical Chemistry.","5","Aditya Rawal","http://www.flipkart.com/modern-approach-chemical-calculations-pb-english/product-reviews/itmdyufk76hgeg6h?pid=9788177096415&srno=b_43&ref=d79533a6-6e46-4435-a8e0-c63f3ea80f91",

"I am a student of BITS Pilani , thus i guess i can give an advice on how to clear BITSAT. The truth is that BITSAT is very easy , infact the easiest entrance exam but still it is hard to crack because of the speed factor. You have to do 150 questions in 3 hours and that is where the problem lies. I figured a crazy solution to this problem by skipping chemistry . I did physics, maths and english problems in BITSAT and did just 3 questions in chemistry as i did not have any knowledge in it because i never studied NCERT . Thus the real way to score in BITSAT is to stick to NCERT and practise, practise and practise. Just have an online test series of resonance and that will work just fine.

"At first I thought the book was very good..but then I realised it had many flaws. Moreover...many questions(especially the tough ones) do not have their detailed solutions at the end of the chapter. Also the book does not have a great theory altogether and the CD with the mock test also has a few glitches here and there. (There is no option to clear the selected answer..so if you make a selection but are not sure of the question...you don t have a choice to deselect it).
On another note...going by the level of questions given for each chapter...solving them can help you for other exams(some of them are previous year s IIT-JEE questions). And there is no stress on English and Logical Reasoning whatsoever.
Also some questions are incomplete and some are not given correct solutions. 
But a plus point of this book is that it has all BITSAT papers(2005-2013) so you can have a look at the level of the questions asked.

"The book covers the syllabus of GATE exhaustively and represents the subject in a systematic, integrated and easily perceptible manner. The book is devised with hierarchy and parallelism in the content which directly helps in preparation of GATE without unreasonable strains. Two introductory articles on methodological understandings and strategy for success in GATE are useful for achieving success in GATE. The content is highly descriptive in theories, derivations, and interpretations, which offers a rich understanding and firm grasp of the basic principles of the subject. A summary of important formulas is also in every chapter that provides a quick review. The book contains around 3000 MCQ\xe2\x80\x99s for practice and confidence building. Every chapter of the book contains rightly answered and explicitly explained questions in Solved Examples, GATE (2002-13), MCQ\xe2\x80\x99s, and NAQ\xe2\x80\x99s.

PROS: Results are arranged in point wise manner which makes this book easy to understand. Also, lots of examples are solved to give detailed content information. A large number of contents are covered making this one of the best coverage books. 
CONS: As I said, it has some pre-requisites. Then, the book has a generalized format and all topics are inter linked making it hard to divide them into class 11 and class 12 material.
